  Over the past year, a handful of new gravitational wave models have
  been developed to include multiple harmonic modes thereby enabling
  for the first time fully Bayesian inference studies including higher
  modes to be performed. Using one recently developed numerical
  relativity surrogate model, NRHybSur3dq8, we investigate the
  importance of higher modes on parameter inference of coalescing
  massive binary black holes. We focus on examples relevant to the
  current three-detector network of observatories, with a detector-
  frame mass set to 120  M⊙ and with signal amplitude values that are
  consistent with plausible candidates for the next few observing
  runs. We show that for such systems the higher mode content will be
  important for interpreting coalescing binary black holes, reducing
  systematic bias, and computing properties of the remnant object.
  Even for comparable-mass binaries and at low signal amplitude, the
  omission of higher modes can influence posterior probability
  distributions. We discuss the impact of our results on source
  population inference and self-consistency tests of general
  relativity. Our work can be used to better understand asymmetric
  binary black hole merger events, such as GW190412. Higher modes are
  critical for such systems, and their omission usually produces
  substantial parameter biases.
