  Brownian coating thermal noise in detector test masses is limiting
  the sensitivity of current gravitational-wave detectors on Earth.
  Therefore, accurate numerical models can inform the ongoing effort
  to minimize Brownian coating thermal noise in current and future
  gravitational-wave detectors. Such numerical models typically
  require significant computational resources and time, and often
  involve closed-source commercial codes. In contrast, open-source
  codes give complete visibility and control of the simulated physics,
  enable direct assessment of the numerical accuracy, and support the
  reproducibility of results. In this article, we use the open-source
  SpECTRE numerical relativity code and adopt a novel discontinuous
  Galerkin numerical method to model Brownian coating thermal noise.
  We demonstrate that SpECTRE achieves significantly higher accuracy
  than a previous approach at a fraction of the computational cost.
  Furthermore, we numerically model Brownian coating thermal noise in
  multiple sub-wavelength crystalline coating layers for the first
  time. Our new numerical method has the potential to enable fast
  exploration of realistic mirror configurations, and hence to guide
  the search for optimal mirror geometries, beam shapes and coating
  materials for gravitational-wave detectors.
