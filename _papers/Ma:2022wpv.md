  We propose two frequency-domain filters to analyze ringdown signals
  of binary black hole mergers. The first rational filter is
  constructed based on a set of (arbitrary) quasinormal modes (QNMs)
  of the remnant black holes, whereas the second full filter comes
  from the transmissivity of the remnant black holes. The two filters
  can remove corresponding QNMs from original time-domain ringdowns,
  while changing early inspiral signals in a trivial way—merely a time
  and phase shift. After filtering out dominant QNMs we can visualize
  the existence of various subdominant effects. For example, by
  applying our filters to a GW150914-like numerical relativity (NR)
  waveform, we find second-order effects in the (l=4,m=4),(l=5,m=4),
  and (l=5,m=5) harmonics;
  the spherical-spheroidal mixing mode in the (l=2,m=2) harmonic; and
  a mixing mode in the (l=2,m=1) harmonic due to a gravitational
  recoil. In another NR simulation where two component spins are
  antialigned with the orbital angular momentum we also find
  retrograde modes. The filters are sensitive to the remnant
  properties (i.e., mass and spin) and thus have a potential
  application to future data analyses and parameter estimations. We
  also investigate the stability of the full filter. Its connection to
  the instability of QNM spectra is discussed.
