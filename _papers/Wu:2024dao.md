  Dynamo processes are ubiquitous in astrophysical systems. In
  relativistic astrophysical systems, such as accretion disks around
  black holes or neutron stars, they may critically affect the
  launching of winds and jets that can power electromagnetic emission.
  Dynamo processes are governed by several microscopic parameters, one
  of them being magnetic helicity. As a conserved quantity in
  nonresistive plasmas, magnetic helicity is transported across the
  system. One important implication of helicity conservation is, that
  in the absence of helicity fluxes some mean-field dynamos can be
  quenched, potentially affecting the large-scale evolution of the
  magnetic field. One of the major challenges in computing magnetic
  helicity is the need to fix a meaningful electromagnetic gauge. We
  here present a fully covariant formulation of magnetic helicity
  transport in general-relativistic plasmas based on the concept of
  relative helicity by Berger and Field and Finn and Antonsen. This
  formulation is separately invariant under gauge-transformation of
  the Maxwell and Einstein equations. As an application of this new
  formalism we present the first analysis of magnetic helicity
  transport in the merger of two neutron stars. We demonstrate the
  presence of global helicity fluxes into the outer layers of the
  stellar merger remnant, which may impact subsequent large-scale
  dynamo amplification in these regions.
