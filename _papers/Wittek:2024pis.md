  Worldtube excision is a method of reducing computational burden in
  Numerical Relativity simulations of binary black holes in situations
  where there is a good analytical model of the geometry around (one
  or both of) the objects. Two such scenarios of relevance in
  gravitational-wave astronomy are (1) the case of mass-disparate
  systems, and (2) the early inspiral when the separation is still
  large. Here we illustrate the utility and flexibility of this
  technique with simulations of the fully self-consistent radiative
  evolution in the model problem of a scalar charge orbiting a
  Schwarzschild black hole under the effect of scalar-field radiation
  reaction. We explore a range of orbital configurations, including
  inspirals with large eccentricity (which we follow through to the
  final plunge and ringdown) and hyperbolic scattering.
