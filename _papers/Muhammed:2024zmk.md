  Binary neutron star mergers produce massive, hot, rapidly
  differentially rotating neutron star remnants; electromagnetic and
  gravitational wave signals associated with the subsequent evolution
  depend on the stability of these remnants. Stability of relativistic
  stars has previously been studied for uniform rotation and for a
  class of differential rotation with monotonic angular velocity
  profiles. Stability of those equilibria to axisymmetric
  perturbations was found to respect a turning point criterion: along
  a constant angular momentum sequence, the onset of unstable stars is
  found at maximum density less than but close to the density of
  maximum mass. In this paper, we test this turning point criterion
  for nonmonotonic angular velocity profiles and nonisentropic entropy
  profiles, both chosen to more realistically model postmerger
  equilibria. Stability is assessed by evolving perturbed equilibria
  in 2D using the spectral einstein Code. We present tests of the
  codeâ€™s new capability for axisymmetric metric evolution. We confirm
  the turning point theorem and determine the region of our rotation
  law parameter space that provides highest maximum mass for a given
  angular momentum.
