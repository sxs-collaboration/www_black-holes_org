  Distinguishing quantum states becomes exponentially difficult as
  their fidelity approaches unity, with diminishing success
  probabilities. This study revisits chaotic dynamics, leveraging
  their extreme sensitivity to initial conditions for rapid
  amplification of state discrimination measures. The discrete-time
  chaotic evolution of qubit states is generated via iterative
  application of a nonlinear conformal map on the Julia set. The
  "quantum microscope" is characterized by a magnification power
  quantified through a temporal Bell-type inequality. Fixed points of
  the conformal map are shown to dictate optimal measurement
  operators, enabling (a) well-defined magnification power and (b)
  bounded Bell-type inequality values, providing a device-independent
  framework for self-testing the microscopes performance.
