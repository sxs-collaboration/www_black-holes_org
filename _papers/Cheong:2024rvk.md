  The conformal flatness approximation to the Einstein equations has
  been successfully used in many astrophysical applications such as
  initial data constructions and dynamical simulations. Although it
  has been shown that full general relativistic strongly
  differentially rotating equilibrium models deviate by at most a few
  percentage from their conformally flat counterparts, whether those
  conformally flat solutions remain stable has not been fully
  addressed. To further understand the limitations of the conformal
  flatness approximation, in this work, we construct spatially
  conformally flat hot hypermassive neutron stars with postmergerlike
  rotation laws, and perform conformally flat evolutions and analysis
  over dynamical timescales. We find that enforcing conformally flat
  spacetime could change the equilibrium of quasitoroidal models with
  high angular momentum for J≳9GM⊙²/c
  compared to fully general relativistic cases. In contrast, all the
  quasispherical models considered in this work remain stable even
  with high angular momentum J=9GM⊙²/c. Our
  investigation suggests that the quasispherical models are suitable
  initial data for long-lived hypermassive neutron star modeling in
  conformally flat spacetime.
