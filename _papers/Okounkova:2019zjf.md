  We produce the first astrophysically relevant numerical binary black
  hole gravitational waveform in a higher-curvature theory of gravity
  beyond general relativity. We simulate a system with parameters
  consistent with GW150914, the first LIGO detection, in order-reduced
  dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, a theory with motivations in string
  theory and loop quantum gravity. We present results for the leading-
  order corrections to the merger and ringdown waveforms, as well as
  the ringdown quasinormal mode spectrum. We estimate that such
  corrections may be discriminated in detections with signal to noise
  ratio ≳180–240, with the precise value depending on the dimension of
  the GR waveform family used in data analysis.
