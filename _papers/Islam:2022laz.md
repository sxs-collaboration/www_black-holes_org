  We present a reduced-order surrogate model of gravitational
  waveforms from nonspinning binary black hole systems with comparable
  to large mass-ratio configurations. This surrogate model,
  BHPTNRSur1dq1e4, is trained on waveform data generated by point-
  particle black hole perturbation theory (ppBHPT) with mass ratios
  varying from 2.5 to 10,000. BHPTNRSur1dq1e4 extends an earlier
  waveform model, EMRISur1dq1e4, by using an updated transition-to-
  plunge model, covering longer durations up to 30,500m<sub>1</sub>
  (where m<sub>1</sub> is the
  mass of the primary black hole), includes several more spherical
  harmonic modes up to ℓ=10, and
  calibrates subdominant modes to numerical relativity (NR) data. In
  the comparable mass-ratio regime, including mass ratios as low as
  2.5, the gravitational waveforms generated through ppBHPT agree
  surprisingly well with those from NR after this simple calibration
  step. We also compare our model to recent SXS and RIT NR simulations
  at mass ratios ranging from 15 to 32, and find the dominant
  quadrupolar modes agree to better than ≈10<sup>-3</sup>.
  We expect our model to be
  useful to study intermediate-mass-ratio binary systems in current
  and future gravitational-wave detectors.
