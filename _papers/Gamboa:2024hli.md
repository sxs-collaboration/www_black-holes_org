  The measurement of orbital eccentricity in gravitational-wave (GW)
  signals will provide unique insights into the astrophysical origin
  of binary systems, while ignoring eccentricity in waveform models
  could introduce significant biases in parameter estimation and tests
  of General Relativity. Upcoming LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs are
  expected to detect a subpopulation of eccentric signals, making it
  vital to develop accurate waveform models for eccentric orbits.
  Here, employing recent analytical results through the third post-
  Newtonian order, we develop SEOBNRv5EHM: a new time-domain,
  effective-one-body, multipolar waveform model for eccentric binary
  black holes with spins aligned (or antialigned) with the orbital
  angular momentum. Besides the dominant (2,2) mode, the model
  includes the (2,1), (3,3), (3,2), (4,4) and (4,3) modes. We validate
  the model's accuracy by computing its unfaithfulness against 99 (28
  public and 71 private) eccentric numerical-relativity (NR)
  simulations, produced by the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes
  Collaboration. Importantly, for NR waveforms with initial GW
  eccentricities below 0.5, the maximum (2,2)-mode unfaithfulness
  across the total mass range 20-200 $M_\odot$ is consistently below
  or close to $1 \%$, with a median value of $ \sim 0.02 \% $,
  reflecting an accuracy improvement of approximately an order of
  magnitude compared to the previous-generation SEOBNRv4EHM and the
  state-of-the-art TEOBResumS-Dalí eccentric model. In the quasi-
  circular-orbit limit, SEOBNRv5EHM is in excellent agreement with the
  highly accurate SEOBNRv5HM model. The accuracy, robustness, and
  speed of SEOBNRv5EHM make it suitable for data analysis and
  astrophysical studies. We demonstrate this by performing a set of
  recovery studies of synthetic NR-signal injections, and parameter-
  estimation analyses of the events GW150914 and GW190521, which we
  find to have no eccentricity signatures.
