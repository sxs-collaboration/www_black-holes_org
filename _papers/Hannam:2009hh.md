  We quantify the consistency of numerical-relativity black-hole-
  binary waveforms for use in gravitational-wave (GW) searches with
  current and planned ground-based detectors. We compare previously
  published results for the \((\ell=2,| m | =2)\) mode of the
  gravitational waves from an equal-mass nonspinning binary,
  calculated by five numerical codes. We focus on the 1000M (about six
  orbits, or 12 GW cycles) before the peak of the GW amplitude and the
  subsequent ringdown. We find that the phase and amplitude agree
  within each code's uncertainty estimates. The mismatch between the
  \((\ell=2,| m| =2)\) modes is better than \(10^{-3}\) for binary masses
  above \(60 M_{\odot}\) with respect to the Enhanced LIGO detector
  noise curve, and for masses above \(180 M_{\odot}\) with respect to
  Advanced LIGO, Virgo and Advanced Virgo. Between the waveforms with
  the best agreement, the mismatch is below \(2 \times 10^{-4}\). We
  find that the waveforms would be indistinguishable in all ground-
  based detectors (and for the masses we consider) if detected with a
  signal-to-noise ratio of less than \(\approx25\).
