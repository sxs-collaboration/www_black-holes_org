  Accurate models of gravitational waves from merging binary black
  holes are crucial for detectors to measure events and extract new
  science. One important feature that is currently missing from the
  Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS) Collaborationâ€™s catalog of
  waveforms for merging black holes, and other waveform catalogs, is
  the gravitational memory effect: a persistent, physical change to
  spacetime that is induced by the passage of transient radiation. We
  find, however, that by exploiting the Bondi-van der Burg-Metzner-
  Sachs (BMS) balance laws, which come from the extended BMS
  transformations, we can correct the strain waveforms in the SXS
  catalog to include the missing displacement memory. Our results show
  that these corrected waveforms satisfy the BMS balance laws to a
  much higher degree of accuracy. Furthermore, we find that these
  corrected strain waveforms coincide especially well with the
  waveforms obtained from Cauchy-characteristic extraction (CCE) that
  already exhibit memory effects. These corrected strain waveforms
  also evade the transient junk effects that are currently present in
  CCE waveforms. Last, we make our code for computing these
  contributions to the BMS balance laws and memory publicly available
  as a part of the python package sxs, thus enabling anyone to
  evaluate the expected memory effects and violation of the BMS
  balance laws.
