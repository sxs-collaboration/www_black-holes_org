  We present improvements to the construction of binary black hole
  initial data used in the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC). We introduce
  new boundary conditions for the extended conformal thin sandwich
  elliptic equations that enforce the excision surfaces to be slightly
  inside rather than on the apparent horizons, thus avoiding
  extrapolation into the black holes at the last stage of initial data
  construction. We find that this improves initial data constraint
  violations near and inside the apparent horizons by about 3 orders
  of magnitude. We construct several initial data sets that are
  intended to be astrophysically equivalent but use different free
  data, boundary conditions, and initial gauge conditions. These
  include free data chosen as a superposition of two black holes in
  time-independent horizon-penetrating harmonic and damped harmonic
  coordinates. We also implement initial data for which the initial
  gauge satisfies the harmonic and damped harmonic gauge conditions;
  this can be done independently of the free data, since this amounts
  to a choice of the time derivatives of the lapse and shift. We
  compare these initial data sets by evolving them. We show that the
  gravitational waveforms extracted during the evolution of these
  different initial data sets agree very well after excluding initial
  transients. However, we do find small differences between these
  waveforms, which we attribute to small differences in initial
  orbital eccentricity, and in initial BH masses and spins, resulting
  from the different choices of free data. Among the cases considered,
  we find that superposed harmonic initial data lead to significantly
  smaller transients, smaller variation in BH spins and masses during
  these transients, smaller constraint violations, and more
  computationally efficient evolutions. Finally, we study the impact
  of initial data choices on the construction of zero-eccentricity
  initial data.
