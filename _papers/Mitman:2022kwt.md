  The Bondi-van der Burg-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) group, which uniquely
  describes the symmetries of asymptotic infinity and therefore of the
  gravitational waves that propagate there, has become increasingly
  important for accurate modeling of waveforms. In particular,
  waveform models, such as post-Newtonian (PN) expressions, numerical
  relativity (NR), and black hole perturbation theory, produce results
  that are in different BMS frames. Consequently, to build a model for
  the waveforms produced during the merging of compact objects, which
  ideally would be a hybridization of PN, NR, and black hole
  perturbation theory, one needs a fast and robust method for fixing
  the BMS freedoms. In this work, we present the first means of fixing
  the entire BMS freedom of NR waveforms to match the frame of either
  PN waveforms or black hole perturbation theory. We achieve this by
  finding the BMS transformations that change certain charges in a
  prescribed way—e.g., finding the center-of-mass transformation that
  maps the center-of-mass charge to a mean of zero. We find that this
  new method is 20 times faster, and more correct when mapping to the
  superrest frame, than previous methods that relied on optimization
  algorithms. Furthermore, in the course of developing this charge-
  based frame fixing method, we compute the PN expression for the
  Moreschi supermomentum to 3PN order without spins and 2PN order with
  spins. This Moreschi supermomentum is effectively equivalent to the
  energy flux or the null memory contribution at future null infinity
  <math display="inline"><msup><mi
  mathvariant="script">I</mi><mo>+</mo></msup></math>. From this PN
  calculation, we also compute oscillatory (<math
  display="inline"><mi>m</mi><mo>≠</mo><mn>0</mn></math> modes) and
  spin-dependent memory terms that have not been identified previously
  or have been missing from strain expressions in the post-Newtonian
  literature.
