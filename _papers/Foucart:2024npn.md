  Binary neutron star mergers play an important role in nuclear
  astrophysics: Their gravitational wave and electromagnetic signals
  carry information about the equation of state of cold matter above
  nuclear saturation density, and they may be one of the main sources
  of r-process elements in the Universe. Neutrino-matter interactions
  during and after merger impact the properties of these
  electromagnetic signals and the relative abundances of the produced
  r-process elements. Existing merger simulations are, however,
  limited in their ability to realistically model neutrino transport
  and neutrino-matter interactions. Here, we perform a comparison of
  the impact of the use of state-of-the art two-moment or Monte Carlo
  transport schemes on the outcome of merger simulations, for a single
  binary neutron star system with a short-lived neutron star remnant
  [(5–10) ms]. We also investigate the use of different reaction rates
  in the simulations. While the best transport schemes generally agree
  well on the qualitative impact of neutrinos on the system,
  differences in the behavior of the high-density regions can
  significantly impact the collapse time and the properties of the hot
  tidal arms in this metastable merger remnant. The chosen interaction
  rates and transport algorithm as well as recent improvements by
  Radice et al. to the two-moment algorithms can all contribute to
  changes at the (10–30)% level in the global properties of the merger
  remnant and outflows. The limitations of previous moment schemes
  fixed by Radice et al. also appear sufficient to explain the large
  difference that we observed in the production of heavy-lepton
  neutrinos in a previous comparison of Monte Carlo and moment schemes
  in the context of a low-mass binary neutron star system.
