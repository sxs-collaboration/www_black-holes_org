  Astrophysical black holes could be nearly extremal (that is,
  rotating nearly as fast as possible), therefore, nearly extremal
  black holes could be among the binaries that current and future
  gravitational-wave observatories will detect. Predicting the
  gravitational waves emitted by merging black holes requires
  numerical-relativity simulations, but these simulations are
  especially challenging when one or both holes have mass m and spin S
  exceeding the Bowen–York limit of \(S/{{m}^{2}}=0.93\). We present
  improved methods that enable us to simulate merging, nearly extremal
  black holes (i.e., black holes with \(S/{{m}^{2}}\gt 0.93\)) more
  robustly and more efficiently. We use these methods to simulate an
  unequal-mass, precessing binary black hole (BBH) coalescence, where
  the larger black hole has \(S/{{m}^{2}}=0.99\). We also use these
  methods to simulate a non-precessing BBH coalescence, where both
  black holes have \(S/{{m}^{2}}=0.994\), nearly reaching the
  Novikov–Thorne upper bound for holes spun up by thin accretion
  disks. We demonstrate numerical convergence and estimate the
  numerical errors of the waveforms, we compare numerical waveforms
  from our simulations with post-Newtonian and effective-one-body
  waveforms, we compare the evolution of the black hole masses and
  spins with analytic predictions, and we explore the effect of
  increasing spin magnitude on the orbital dynamics (the so-called
  ‘orbital hangup’ effect).
