  Spin-orbit resonances have important astrophysical implications as
  the evolution and subsequent coalescence of supermassive black hole
  binaries in one of these configurations may lead to low recoil
  velocity of merger remnants. It has also been shown that black hole
  spins in comparable mass stellar-mass black hole binaries could
  preferentially lie in a resonant plane when their gravitational
  waves (GWs) enter the advanced LIGO frequency band [1]. Therefore,
  it is highly desirable to investigate the possibility of detection
  and subsequent characterization of such GW sources in the advanced
  detector era, which can, in turn, improve our perception of their
  high mass counterparts. The current detection pipelines involve only
  nonprecessing templates for compact binary searches whereas
  parameter estimation pipelines can afford to use approximate
  precessing templates. In this paper, we test the performance of
  these templates in detection and characterization of spin-orbit
  resonant binaries. We use fully precessing time-domain SEOBNRv3
  waveforms as well as four numerical relativity (NR) waveforms to
  model GWs from spin-orbit resonant binaries and filter them through
  IMRPhenomD, SEOBNRv4 and IMRPhenomPv2 approximants. We find that the
  nonprecessing approximants IMRPhenomD and SEOBNRv4 recover only ∼70%
  of injections with fitting factor (FF) higher than 0.97 (or 90% of
  injections with FF>0.9). This loss in signal-to-noise ratio is
  mainly due to the missing physics in these approximants in terms of
  precession and nonquadrupole modes. However, if we use a new
  statistic, i.e., maximizing the matched filter output over the sky-
  location parameters as well, the precessing approximant IMRPhenomPv2
  performs magnificently better than their nonprecessing counterparts
  with recovering 99% of the injections with FFs higher than 0.97.
  Interestingly, injections with Δϕ=180° have higher FFs (Δϕ is the
  angle between the components of the black hole spins in the plane
  orthogonal to the orbital angular momentum) as compared to their
  Δϕ=0° and generic counterparts. This is because Δϕ=180° binaries are
  not as strongly precessing as Δϕ=0° and generic binaries. This
  implies that we will have a slight observation bias towards Δϕ=180°
  and away from Δϕ=0° resonant binaries while using nonprecessing
  templates for searches. Moreover, all template approximants are able
  to recover most of the injected NR waveforms with FFs >0.95. For all
  the injections including NR, the systematic error in estimating
  chirp mass remains below <10% with minimum error for Δϕ=180°
  resonant binaries. The symmetric mass-ratio can be estimated with
  errors below 15%. The effective spin parameter χeff is measured with
  maximum absolute error of 0.13. The in-plane spin parameter χp is
  mostly underestimated indicating that a precessing signal will be
  recovered as a relatively less precessing signal. Based on our
  findings, we conclude that we not only need improvements in waveform
  models towards precession and nonquadrupole modes but also better
  search strategies for precessing GW signals.
