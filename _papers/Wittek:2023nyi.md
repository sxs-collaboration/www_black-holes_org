abstract: |
  Binary black hole simulations become increasingly more
  computationally expensive with smaller mass ratios, partly because
  of the longer evolution time, and partly because the lengthscale
  disparity dictates smaller time steps. The program initiated by
  Dhesi et al. [Phys. Rev. D 104, 124002 (2021)] explores a method for
  alleviating the scale disparity in simulations with mass ratios in
  the intermediate astrophysical range (10^-4 <= q <= 10^-2), where purely
  perturbative methods may not be adequate. A region (“worldtube”)
  much larger than the small black hole is excised from the numerical
  domain, and replaced with an analytical model approximating a
  tidally deformed black hole. Here we apply this idea to a toy model
  of a scalar charge in a fixed circular geodesic orbit around a
  Schwarzschild black hole, solving for the massless Klein-Gordon
  field. This is a first implementation of the worldtube excision
  method in full 3+1
  dimensions. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the
  method, and discuss the steps toward applying it for evolving orbits
  and, ultimately, in the binary black-hole scenario. Our
  implementation is publicly accessible in the spectre numerical
  relativity code.
