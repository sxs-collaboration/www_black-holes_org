  We present successful evolutions of binary black hole mergers using
  a novel numerical-relativity technique known as Cauchy-
  characteristic matching (CCM). This approach eliminates systematic
  errors associated with boundary conditions, effectively extending
  the computational domain to infinity. As an important application,
  we use CCM to resolve a late-time power-law tail in the
  gravitational wave from a head-on collision, and show that the tail
  is highly suppressed in a quasi-circular binary. Our results for the
  two extreme cases (orbital eccentricity $=0,1$) support the fact
  that tails increase with orbital eccentricity. Therefore, CCM paves
  the way for a detailed understanding of tails in eccentric systems.
  For the head-on case, we find that the tail behavior is consistent
  with predictions in the intermediate regime from black hole linear
  perturbation theory. However, we also raise the possibility that the
  power-law tail could be generated nonlinearly by quasinormal modes.
  The nonlinear contribution is expected to decay slower than
  predicted by Price's law, potentially dominating the signal at late
  times. If confirmed as nonlinear, this would be an example where
  nonlinearity prevails over linearity in the late-time regime of
  black hole dynamics.
