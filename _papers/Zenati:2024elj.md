  Black hole–neutron star binaries are of interest in many ways: they
  are intrinsically transient, radiate gravitational waves detectable
  by LIGO, and may produce γ-ray bursts. Although it has long been
  assumed that their late-stage orbital evolution is driven entirely
  by gravitational wave emission, we show here that in certain
  circumstances, mass transfer from the neutron star onto the black
  hole can both alter the binary's orbital evolution and significantly
  reduce the neutron star's mass: when the fraction of its mass
  transferred per orbit is ≳\(10^{−2}\), the neutron star's mass
  diminishes by order unity, leading to mergers in which the neutron
  star mass is exceptionally small. The mass transfer creates a gas
  disk around the black hole before merger that can be comparable in
  mass to the debris remaining after merger, i.e., ~0.1 \(M_{⊙}\). These
  processes are most important when the initial neutron star–black
  hole mass ratio q is in the range ≈0.2–0.8, the orbital semimajor
  axis is 40 ≲ \(a_{0}/r_{g}\) ≲ 300 (\(r_{g}\) ≡ \(GM_{BH}/c^{2}\)),
  and the eccentricity is large at \(e_{0}\) ≳ 0.8. Systems of this sort
  may be generated through the dynamical evolution of a triple system,
  as well as by other means.
