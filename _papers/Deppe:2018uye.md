  We present results from a study of critical behavior in 3D
  gravitational collapse with no symmetry assumptions. The source of
  the gravitational field is a massless scalar field. This is a well-
  studied case for spherically symmetric gravitational collapse,
  allowing us to understand the reliability and accuracy of the
  simulations. We study both supercritical and subcritical evolutions
  to see if one provides more accurate results than the other. We find
  that even for nonspherical initial data with 35% of the power in the
  â„“=2 spherical harmonic, the critical solution is the same as in
  spherical symmetry.
