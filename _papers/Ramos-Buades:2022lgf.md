  The modeling of unequal mass binary black hole systems is of high
  importance to detect and estimate parameters from these systems.
  Numerical relativity (NR) is well suited to study systems with
  comparable component masses, m1∼m2,
  whereas small mass ratio (SMR) perturbation theory applies to
  binaries where q=m2/m1≪1. This work investigates the applicability
  for NR and SMR as a function of mass ratio for eccentric nonspinning
  binary black holes. We produce 52 NR simulations with mass ratios
  between 1:10 and 1:1 and initial
  eccentricities up to 0.8. From these we extract quantities like
  gravitational wave energy and angular momentum fluxes and periastron
  advance, and assess their accuracy. To facilitate comparison, we
  develop tools to map between NR and SMR inspiral evolutions of
  eccentric binary black holes. We derive post-Newtonian accurate
  relations between different definitions of eccentricity. Based on
  these analyses, we introduce a new definition of eccentricity based
  on the (2,2)-mode of the gravitational radiation, which reduces to
  the Newtonian definition of eccentricity in the Newtonian limit.
  From the comparison between NR simulations and SMR results, we
  quantify the unknown next-to-leading order SMR contributions to the
  gravitational energy and angular momentum fluxes, and periastron
  advance. We show that in the comparable mass regime these
  contributions are subdominant and higher order SMR contributions are
  negligible.
