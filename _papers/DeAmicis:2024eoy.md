  We uncover late-time gravitational-wave tails in fully nonlinear 3+1
  dimensional numerical relativity simulations of merging black holes,
  using the highly accurate SpEC code. We achieve this result by
  exploiting the strong magnification of late-time tails due to binary
  eccentricity, recently observed in perturbative evolutions, and
  showcase here the tail presence in head-on configurations for
  several mass ratios close to unity. We validate the result through a
  large battery of numerical tests and detailed comparison with
  perturbative evolutions, which display striking agreement with full
  nonlinear ones. Our results offer yet another confirmation of the
  highly predictive power of black hole perturbation theory in the
  presence of a source, even when applied to nonlinear solutions. The
  late-time tail signal is much more prominent than anticipated until
  recently, and possibly within reach of gravitational-wave detectors
  measurements, unlocking observational investigations of an
  additional set of general relativistic predictions on the long-range
  gravitational dynamics.
