  Black hole–torus systems from compact binary mergers are possible
  engines for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). During the early evolution of
  the postmerger remnant, the state of the torus is determined by a
  combination of neutrino cooling and magnetically driven heating
  processes, so realistic models must include both effects. In this
  paper, we study the postmerger evolution of a magnetized black
  hole–neutron star binary system using the Spectral Einstein Code
  (SpEC) from an initial postmerger state provided by previous
  numerical relativity simulations. We use a finite-temperature
  nuclear equation of state and incorporate neutrino effects in a
  leakage approximation. To achieve the needed accuracy, we introduce
  improvements to SpEC’s implementation of general-relativistic
  magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), including the use of cubed-sphere
  multipatch grids and an improved method for dealing with supersonic
  accretion flows where primitive variable recovery is difficult. We
  find that a seed magnetic field triggers a sustained source of
  heating, but its thermal effects are largely cancelled by the
  accretion and spreading of the torus from MHD-related angular
  momentum transport. The neutrino luminosity peaks at the start of
  the simulation, and then drops significantly over the first 20 ms
  but in roughly the same way for magnetized and nonmagnetized disks.
  The heating rate and disk’s luminosity decrease much more slowly
  thereafter. These features of the evolution are insensitive to grid
  structure and resolution, formulation of the MHD equations, and seed
  field strength, although turbulent effects are not fully converged.
