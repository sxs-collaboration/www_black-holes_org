  Detectable electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational waves from
  compact binary mergers can be produced by outflows from the black
  hole-accretion disk remnant during the first 10 s after the merger.
  Two-dimensional axisymmetric simulations with effective viscosity
  remain an efficient and informative way to model this late-time
  post-merger evolution. In addition to the inherent approximations of
  axisymmetry and modeling turbulent angular momentum transport by a
  viscosity, previous simulations often make other simplifications
  related to the treatment of the equation of state and turbulent
  transport effects. In this paper, we test the effect of these
  modeling choices. By evolving with the same viscosity the exact
  post-merger initial configuration previously evolved in Newtonian
  viscous hydrodynamics, we find that the Newtonian treatment provides
  a good estimate of the disk ejecta mass but underestimates the
  outflow velocity. We find that the inclusion of heavy nuclei causes
  a notable increase in ejecta mass. An approximate inclusion of
  r-process effects has a comparatively smaller effect, except for its
  designed effect on the composition. Diffusion of composition and
  entropy, modeling turbulent transport effects, has the overall
  effect of reducing ejecta mass and giving it a speed with lower
  average and more tightly-peaked distribution. Also, we find
  significant acceleration of outflow even at distances beyond
  10 000 km, so that thermal wind velocities only asymptote beyond
  this radius and at higher values than often reported.
