  One of the most promising avenues to perform numerical evolutions in
  theories beyond general relativity is the fixing-the-equations
  approach, a proposal in which new “driver” equations are added to
  the evolution equations in a way that allows for stable numerical
  evolutions. In this direction, we extend the numerical relativity
  code spectre to evolve a “fixed” version of scalar Gauss-Bonnet
  theory in the decoupling limit, a phenomenologically interesting
  theory that allows for hairy black hole solutions in vacuum. We
  focus on isolated black hole systems both with and without linear
  and angular momentum, and propose a new driver equation to improve
  the recovery of such stationary solutions. We demonstrate the
  effectiveness of the latter by numerically evolving black holes that
  undergo spontaneous scalarization using different driver equations.
  Finally, we evaluate the accuracy of the obtained solutions by
  comparing with the original unaltered theory.
