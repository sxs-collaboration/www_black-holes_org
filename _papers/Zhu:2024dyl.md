  We numerically investigate the imprints of gravitational radiation-
  reaction driven changes to a black hole's mass and spin on the
  corresponding ringdown waveform. We do so by comparing the dynamics
  of a perturbed black hole evolved with the full (nonlinear) versus
  linearized Einstein equations. As expected, we find that the
  quasinormal mode amplitudes extracted from nonlinear evolution
  deviate from their linear counterparts at third order in initial
  perturbation amplitude. For perturbations leading to a change in the
  black hole mass and spin of \(\sim 5\%\), which is reasonable for a
  remnant formed in an astrophysical merger, we find that nonlinear
  distortions to the complex amplitudes of some quasinormal modes can
  be as large as \(\sim 50\%\) at the peak of the waveform. Furthermore,
  the change in the mass and spin results in a drift in the
  quasinormal mode frequencies, which for large amplitude
  perturbations causes the nonlinear waveform to rapidly dephase with
  respect to its linear counterpart. %These two nonlinear effects
  together create a large distortion in both the amplitude and phase
  of the ringdown gravitational waveform. Surprisingly, despite these
  nonlinear effects creating significant deviations in the nonlinear
  waveform, we show that a linear quasinormal mode model still
  performs quite well from close to the peak amplitude onwards.
