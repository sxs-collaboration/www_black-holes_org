  We numerically investigate the imprints of gravitational radiation-
  reaction driven changes to a black hole’s mass and spin on the
  corresponding ringdown waveform. We do so by comparing the dynamics
  of a perturbed black hole evolved with the full (nonlinear) versus
  linearized Einstein equations. As expected, we find that the
  quasinormal mode amplitudes extracted from nonlinear evolution
  deviate from their linear counterparts at third order in initial
  perturbation amplitude. For perturbations leading to a change in the
  black hole mass and spin of <math
  display="inline"><mo>∼</mo><mn>5</mn><mo>%</mo></math>, which is
  reasonable for a remnant formed in an astrophysical merger, we find
  that nonlinear distortions to the complex amplitudes of some
  quasinormal modes can be as large as <math
  display="inline"><mo>∼</mo><mn>50</mn><mo>%</mo></math> at the peak
  of the waveform. Furthermore, the change in the mass and spin
  results in a drift in the quasinormal mode frequencies, which for
  large amplitude perturbations causes the nonlinear waveform to
  rapidly dephase with respect to its linear counterpart.
  Surprisingly, despite these nonlinear effects creating significant
  deviations in the nonlinear waveform, we show that a linear
  quasinormal mode model still performs quite well from close to the
  peak amplitude onward. Comparing the quality of quasinormal mode
  fits for the linear and nonlinear waveforms, we show that the main
  obstruction to measuring high-<math
  display="inline"><mi>n</mi></math> overtones is the transient part
  of the waveform, already present at the linear level.
