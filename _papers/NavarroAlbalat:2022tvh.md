  Recent studies have shown the surprising effectiveness of the small
  mass-ratio approximation (SMR) in modeling the relativistic two-body
  problem even at comparable masses. Up to now this effectiveness has
  been demonstrated only during inspiral, before the binary
  transitions into plunge and merger. Here we examine the binding
  energy of nonspinning binary black hole simulations with mass ratios
  from <math
  display="inline"><mrow><mn>20</mn><mo>∶</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></math>
  to equal mass. We show for the first time that the binaries undergo
  a transition to plunge as predicted by analytic theory, and estimate
  the size of the transition region, which is <math
  display="inline"><mo>∼</mo><mn>10</mn></math> gravitational wave
  cycles for equal mass binaries. By including transition, the SMR
  expansion of the binding energy is accurate until the last cycle of
  gravitational wave emission. This is true even for comparable mass
  binaries such as those observed by current gravitational wave
  detectors, where the transition often makes up much of the observed
  signal. Our work provides further evidence that the SMR
  approximation can be directly applied to current gravitational wave
  observations.
