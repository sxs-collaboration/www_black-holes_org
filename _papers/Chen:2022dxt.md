abstract: |
  We construct the covariantly defined multipole moments on the common
  horizon of an equal-mass, nonspinning, quasicircular binary-black-
  hole system. We see a strong correlation between these multipole
  moments and the gravitational waveform. We find that the multipole
  moments are well described by the fundamental quasinormal modes at
  sufficiently late times. For each nonzero multipole moment with
  <math
  display="inline"><mrow><mo>ℓ</mo><mo>≤</mo><mn>6</mn></mrow></math>,
  at least two fundamental quasinormal modes of different <math
  display="inline"><mo>ℓ</mo></math> are detectable in the best model.
  These models provide faithful estimates of the true mass and spin of
  the remnant black hole. We also show that by including overtones,
  the <math display="inline"><mo>ℓ</mo><mo>=</mo><mi>m</mi><mo>=</mo><
  mn>2</mn></math> mass multipole moment admits an excellent
  quasinormal-mode description at all times after the merger. This
  demonstrates the perhaps surprising power of perturbation theory
  near the merger.
