  We develop new strategies to build numerical relativity surrogate
  models for eccentric binary black hole systems, which are expected
  to play an increasingly important role in current and future
  gravitational-wave detectors. We introduce a new surrogate waveform
  model, NRSur2dq1Ecc, using 47 nonspinning, equal-mass waveforms with
  eccentricities up to 0.2 when measured at a reference time of 5500M
  before merger. This is the first waveform model that is directly
  trained on eccentric numerical relativity simulations and does not
  require that the binary circularizes before merger. The model
  includes the (2,2), (3,2), and (4,4) spin-weighted spherical
  harmonic modes. We also build a final black hole model,
  NRSur2dq1EccRemnant, which models the mass, and spin of the remnant
  black hole. We show that our waveform model can accurately predict
  numerical relativity waveforms with mismatches ≈10-3, while the
  remnant model can recover the final mass and dimensionless spin with
  absolute errors smaller than ≈5×10-4M and ≈2×10-3 respectively. We
  demonstrate that the waveform model can also recover subtle effects
  like mode mixing in the ringdown signal without any special ad hoc
  modeling steps. Finally, we show that despite being trained only on
  equal-mass binaries, NRSur2dq1Ecc can be reasonably extended up to
  mass ratio q≈3 with mismatches ≃10-2 for eccentricities smaller than
  ∼0.05 as measured at a reference time of 2000M before merger. The
  methods developed here should prove useful in the building of future
  eccentric surrogate models over larger regions of the parameter
  space.
