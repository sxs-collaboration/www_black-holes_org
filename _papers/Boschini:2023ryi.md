  Numerical-relativity surrogate models for both black-hole merger
  waveforms and remnants have emerged as important tools in
  gravitational-wave astronomy. While producing very accurate
  predictions, their applicability is limited to the region of the
  parameter space where numerical-relativity simulations are available
  and computationally feasible. Notably, this excludes extreme mass
  ratios. We present a machine-learning approach to extend the
  validity of existing and future numerical-relativity surrogate
  models toward the test-particle limit, targeting in particular the
  mass and spin of postmerger black-hole remnants. Our model is
  trained on both numerical-relativity simulations at comparable
  masses and analytical predictions at extreme mass ratios. We extend
  the gaussian-process-regression model NRSur7dq4Remnant, validate its
  performance via cross validation, and test its accuracy against
  additional numerical-relativity runs. Our fit, which we dub
  NRSur7dq4EmriRemnant, reaches an accuracy that is comparable to or
  higher than that of existing remnant models while providing robust
  predictions for arbitrary mass ratios.
