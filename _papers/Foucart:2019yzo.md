  High-accuracy numerical simulations of merging neutron stars play an
  important role in testing and calibrating the waveform models used
  by gravitational wave observatories. Obtaining high-accuracy
  waveforms at a reasonable computational cost, however, remains a
  significant challenge. One issue is that high-order convergence of
  the solution requires the use of smooth evolution variables, while
  many of the equations of state used to model the neutron star matter
  have discontinuities, typically in the first derivative of the
  pressure. Spectral formulations of the equation of state have been
  proposed as a potential solution to this problem. Here, we report on
  the numerical implementation of spectral equations of state in the
  spectral Einstein code. We show that, in our code, spectral
  equations of state allow for high-accuracy simulations at a lower
  computational cost than commonly used “piecewise polytrope”
  equations state. We also demonstrate that not all spectral equations
  of state are equally useful: different choices for the low-density
  part of the equation of state can significantly impact the cost and
  accuracy of simulations. As a result, simulations of neutron star
  mergers present us with a trade-off between the cost of simulations
  and the physical realism of the chosen equation of state.
