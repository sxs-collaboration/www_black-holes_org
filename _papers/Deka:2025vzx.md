  The anticipated observation of the gravitational microlensing of
  gravitational waves (GWs) promises to shed light on a host of
  astrophysical and cosmological questions. However, extracting the
  parameters of the lens from the modulated GWs requires accurate
  modeling of the lensing amplification factor, accounting for wave-
  optics effects. Analytic solutions to the lens equation have not
  been found to date, except for a handful of simplistic lens models.
  While numerical solutions to this equation have been developed, the
  time and computational resources required to evaluate the
  amplification factor numerically make large-scale parameter
  estimation of the lens (and source) parameters prohibitive. On the
  other hand, surrogate modeling of GWs has proven to be a powerful
  tool to accurately, and rapidly, produce GW templates at arbitrary
  points in parameter space, interpolating from a finite set of
  available waveforms at discrete parameter values. In this work, we
  demonstrate that surrogate modeling can also effectively be applied
  to the evaluation of the time-domain microlensing amplification
  factor $\widetilde{F}(t)$, for arbitrary lens configurations. We
  show this by constructing $\widetilde{F}(t)$ for two lens models,
  viz. point-mass lens, and singular isothermal sphere, which notably
  includes logarithmic divergence behaviour. We find both surrogates
  reproduce the original lens models accurately, with mismatches
  $\lesssim 5 \times 10^{-4}$ across a range of plausible microlensed
  binary black hole sources observed by the Einstein Telescope. This
  surrogate is between 5 and $10^3$ times faster than the underlying
  lensing models, and can be evaluated in about 100 ms. The accuracy
  and efficiency attained by our surrogate models will enable
  practical parameter estimation analyses of microlensed GWs.
