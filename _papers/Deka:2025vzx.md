  The anticipated observation of the gravitational microlensing of
  gravitational waves (GWs) promises to shed light on a host of
  astrophysical and cosmological questions. However, extracting the
  parameters of the lens from the modulated GWs requires accurate
  modeling of the lensing amplification factor, accounting for wave-
  optics effects. Analytic solutions to the lens equation have not
  been found to date, except for a handful of simplistic lens models.
  While numerical solutions to this equation have been developed, the
  time and computational resources required to evaluate the
  amplification factor numerically make large-scale parameter
  estimation of the lens (and source) parameters prohibitive. On the
  other hand, surrogate modeling of GWs has proven to be a powerful
  tool to accurately, and rapidly, produce GW templates at arbitrary
  points in parameter space, interpolating from a finite set of
  available waveforms at discrete parameter values. In this work, we
  demonstrate that surrogate modeling can also effectively be applied
  to the evaluation of the time-domain microlensing amplification
  factor $\widetilde{F}(t)$, for arbitrary lens configurations. We
  show this by constructing $\widetilde{F}(t)$ for two lens models,
  viz. point-mass lens, and singular isothermal sphere. We benchmark
  the evaluation times, and accuracy, of the surrogate microlensed
  templates, and show that indeed surrogate modeling is a powerful
  tool to make large-scale parameter estimation in the context of
  microlensed GWs practicable.
