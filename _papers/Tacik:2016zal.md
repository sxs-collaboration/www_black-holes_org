  The coalescence of a neutron star with a black hole is a primary
  science target of ground-based gravitational wave detectors.
  Constraining or measuring the neutron star spin directly from
  gravitational wave observations requires knowledge of the dependence
  of the emission properties of these systems on the neutron star
  spin. This paper lays foundations for this task, by developing a
  numerical method to construct initial data for black hole–neutron
  star binaries with arbitrary spin on the neutron star. We
  demonstrate the robustness of the code by constructing initial-data
  sets in large regions of the parameter space. In addition to varying
  the neutron star spin-magnitude and spin-direction, we also explore
  neutron star compactness, mass-ratio, black hole spin, and black
  hole spin-direction. Specifically, we are able to construct initial
  data sets with neutron stars spinning near centrifugal break-up, and
  with black hole spins as large as
  \({S}_{\mathrm{BH}}/{M}_{\mathrm{BH}}^{2}=0.99\).
