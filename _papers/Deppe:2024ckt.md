  We present a discontinuous Galerkin-finite difference hybrid scheme
  that allows high-order shock capturing with the discontinuous
  Galerkin method for general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics in
  dynamical spacetimes. We present several optimizations and stability
  improvements to our algorithm that allow the hybrid method to
  successfully simulate single, rotating, and binary neutron stars.
  The hybrid method achieves the efficiency of discontinuous Galerkin
  methods throughout almost the entire spacetime during the inspiral
  phase, while being able to robustly capture shocks and resolve the
  stellar surfaces. We also use Cauchy-characteristic evolution to
  compute the first gravitational waveforms at future null infinity
  from binary neutron star mergers. The simulations presented here are
  the first successful binary neutron star inspiral and merger
  simulations using discontinuous Galerkin methods.
