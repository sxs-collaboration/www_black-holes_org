  We present a formulation of general-relativistic (GR) 19-moment
  dissipative magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), capable of handling all
  first-order dissipative terms (viscosity, heat conductivity,
  resistivity and Hall terms), as well as all ideal electron degrees
  of freedom (number density, momentum and energy) in a GR
  astrophysical two-fluid plasma. We derive necessary and sufficient
  nonlinear causality conditions for the constrained first-order
  19-moment system, as well as both necessary and sufficient
  conditions for strong hyperbolicity. To assess the formulation
  numerically, we develop a high-resolution shock-capturing scheme
  that solves these equations in a performance-portable fashion. The
  scheme expresses all evolution equations, including the dissipative
  and electron sectors, in flux-divergence form, allowing us to model
  systems with scales separated by orders of magnitude without
  resolving kinetic scales everywhere on the grid. In addition, we use
  implicit integration methods to systematically overstep kinetic
  scales in MHD regions, such as cyclotron and plasma frequencies. To
  make the scheme as robust as GRMHD codes, we construct necessary and
  sufficient conditions for a conserved state to be physically
  admissible, and based on these construct a new physicality-
  enforcement scheme. As an exact validation comparison, we formulate
  and derive a full solution to dissipative two-fluid Bondi accretion
  in general relativity. We then validate the equations against a
  series of results from kinetic particle-in-cell models of black hole
  accretion and magnetospheric dynamics, demonstrating that our
  formulation and scheme can correctly capture major features relevant
  for feedback on global scales of these solutions, including
  dimensionless reconnection rates of order \(0.1\) and Braginskii-
  like anisotropic pressures and heat fluxes.
