  We investigate quadratic quasinormal mode coupling in black hole
  spacetime through numerical experiments of single perturbed black
  holes using both numerical relativity and second-order black hole
  perturbation theory. Focusing on the dominant <math
  display="inline"><mo>ℓ</mo><mo>=</mo><mo
  stretchy="false">|</mo><mi>m</mi><mo
  stretchy="false">|</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn></math> quadrupolar
  modes, we find good agreement (within <math
  display="inline"><mo>∼</mo><mn>10</mn><mo>%</mo></math>) between
  these approaches, with discrepancies attributed to truncation error
  and uncertainties from mode fitting. Our results align with earlier
  studies extracting the coupling coefficients from select binary
  black hole merger simulations, showing consistency for the same
  remnant spins. Notably, the coupling coefficient is insensitive to a
  diverse range of initial data, including configurations that led to
  a significant (up to 5%) increase in the remnant black hole mass.
  These findings present opportunities for testing the nonlinear
  dynamics of general relativity with ground-based gravitational wave
  observatories. Lastly, we provide evidence of a bifurcation in
  coupling coefficients between counterrotating and corotating
  quasinormal modes as black hole spin increases.
