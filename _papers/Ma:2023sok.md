  We present a numerical-relativity simulation of a black hole-neutron
  star merger in scalar-tensor (ST) gravity with binary parameters
  consistent with the gravitational wave event GW200115. In this
  exploratory simulation, we consider the Damour-Esposito-Farèse
  extension to Brans-Dicke theory, and maximize the effect of
  spontaneous scalarization by choosing a soft equation of state and
  ST theory parameters at the edge of known constraints. We
  extrapolate the gravitational waves, including tensor and scalar
  (breathing) modes, to future null-infinity. The numerical waveforms
  undergo <math display="inline"><mo>∼</mo><mn>22</mn></math> wave
  cycles before the merger, and are in good agreement with predictions
  from post-Newtonian theory during the inspiral. We find the ST
  system evolves faster than its general-relativity (GR) counterpart
  due to dipole radiation, merging a full gravitational-wave cycle
  before the GR counterpart. This enables easy differentiation between
  the ST waveforms and GR in the context of parameter estimation.
  However, we find that dipole radiation’s effect may be partially
  degenerate with the NS tidal deformability during the late inspiral
  stage, and a full Bayesian analysis is necessary to fully understand
  the degeneracies between ST and binary parameters in GR.
