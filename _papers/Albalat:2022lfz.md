  We present a calculation of the Detweiler redshift factor in binary
  black hole simulations based on its relation to the surface gravity.
  The redshift factor has far-reaching applications in analytic
  approximations, gravitational self-force calculations, and
  conservative two-body dynamics. By specializing to nonspinning,
  quasicircular binaries with mass ratios ranging from mA/mB=1 to
  mA/mB=9.5 we are able to recover the
  leading small-mass-ratio (SMR) prediction with relative differences
  of order <math display="inline"><msup><mn>10</mn><mrow><mo>-
  </mo><mn>5</mn></mrow></msup></math> from simulations alone. The
  next-to-leading order term that we extract agrees with the SMR
  prediction arising from self-force calculations, with differences of
  a few percent. These deviations from the first-order conservative
  prediction are consistent with nonadiabatic effects that can be
  accommodated in an SMR expansion. This fact is also supported by a
  comparison to the conservative post-Newtonian prediction of the
  redshifts. For the individual redshifts, a reexpansion in terms of
  the symmetric mass ratio <math display="inline"><mi>ν</mi></math>
  does not improve the convergence of the series. However we find that
  when looking at the sum of the redshift factors of both back holes,
  zA+zB, which is symmetric under the
  exchange of the masses, a reexpansion in ν accelerates its
  convergence. Our
  work provides further evidence of the surprising effectiveness of
  SMR approximations in modeling even comparable mass binary black
  holes.
