  Each of the potential signals from a black hole–neutron star merger
  should contain an imprint of the neutron star equation of state:
  gravitational waves via its effect on tidal disruption, the kilonova
  via its effect on the ejecta, and the gamma-ray burst via its effect
  on the remnant disk. These effects have been studied by numerical
  simulations and quantified by semianalytic formulas. However, most
  of the simulations on which these formulas are based use equations
  of state without finite temperature and composition-dependent
  nuclear physics. In this paper, we simulate black hole–neutron star
  mergers varying both the neutron star mass and the equation of
  state, using three finite-temperature nuclear models of varying
  stiffness. Our simulations largely vindicate formulas for ejecta
  properties but do not find the expected dependence of disk mass on
  neutron star compaction. We track the early evolution of the
  accretion disk, largely driven by shocking and fallback inflow, and
  do find notable equation-of-state effects on the structure of this
  early-time, neutrino-bright disk.
