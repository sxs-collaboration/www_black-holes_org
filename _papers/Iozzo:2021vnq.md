  We present a new study of remnant black hole properties from 13
  binary black hole systems, numerically evolved using the Spectral
  Einstein Code. The mass, spin, and recoil velocity of each remnant
  were determined quasilocally from apparent horizon data and
  asymptotically from Bondi data (h,ψ4,ψ3,ψ2,ψ1) computed at future
  null infinity using SpECTRE’s Cauchy characteristic evolution. We
  compare these independent measurements of the remnant properties in
  the bulk and on the boundary of the spacetime, giving insight into
  how well asymptotic data are able to reproduce local properties of
  the remnant black hole in numerical relativity. We also discuss the
  theoretical framework for connecting horizon quantities to
  asymptotic quantities and how it relates to our results. This study
  recommends a simple improvement to the recoil velocities reported in
  the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes waveform catalog, provides an
  improvement to future surrogate remnant models, and offers new
  analysis techniques for evaluating the physical accuracy of
  numerical simulations.
