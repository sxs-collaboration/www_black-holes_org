abstract: |
  The discovery of GW170817 with gravitational waves (GWs) and
  electromagnetic (EM) radiation is prompting new questions in strong-
  gravity astrophysics. Importantly, it remains unknown whether the
  progenitor of the merger comprised two neutron stars (NSs) or a NS
  and a black hole (BH). Using new numerical-relativity simulations
  and incorporating modeling uncertainties, we produce novel GW and EM
  observables for NS-BH mergers with similar masses. A joint analysis
  of GW and EM measurements reveals that if GW170817 is a NS-BH
  merger, â‰²40% of the binary parameters consistent with the GW data
  are compatible with EM observations.
