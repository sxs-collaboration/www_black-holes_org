  The spectroscopic study of black hole quasinormal modes in
  gravitational-wave ringdown observations is hindered by our
  ignorance of which modes should dominate astrophysical signals for
  different binary configurations, limiting tests of general
  relativity and astrophysics. In this work, we present a description
  of the quasinormal modes that are excited in the ringdowns of
  comparable mass, quasi-circular precessing binary black hole
  coalescences -- a key region of parameter space that has yet to be
  fully explored within the framework of black hole spectroscopy. We
  suggest that the remnant perturbation for precessing and non-
  precessing systems is approximately the same up to a rotation, which
  implies that the relative amplitudes of the quasinormal modes in
  both systems are also related by a rotation. We present evidence for
  this by analyzing an extensive catalog of numerical relativity
  simulations. Additional structure in the amplitudes is connected to
  the system's kick velocity and other asymmetries in the orbital
  dynamics. We find that the ringdowns of precessing systems need not
  be dominated by the \({(\ell,m)=(2,\pm 2)}\) quasinormal modes, and
  that instead the \((2,\pm 1)\) or \((2,0)\) quasinormal modes can
  dominate. Our results are consistent with a ringdown analysis of the
  LIGO-Virgo gravitational wave signal GW190521, and may also help in
  understanding phenomenological inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform
  model systematics.
