  In the presence of anisotropic neutrino and antineutrino fluxes, the
  quantum kinetic equations drive coherent oscillations in neutrino
  helicity, frequently referred to as spin oscillations. These
  oscillations depend directly on the absolute mass scale and Majorana
  phase, but are usually too transient to produce important effects.
  In this paper we present a full momentum-space analysis of Majorana
  neutrino spin oscillations in a snapshot of a three-dimensional
  neutron star merger simulation. We find an interesting angular
  dependence that allows for that resonant and adiabatic oscillations
  to occur along specific directions in a large volume of the merger
  remnant. The solid angle spanned by these directions is extremely
  narrow in general. We then analyze spin transformation in the
  presence of flavor transformation by characterizing how the effectâ€™s
  resonance and timescale change during a fast-flavor instability. For
  this analysis, we derive a generalized resonance condition that
  poses a restrictive requirement for resonance to exist in any flavor
  channel. We determine that spin oscillations at all locations in the
  merger snapshot have a length scale that is too large for
  significant oscillations to be expected even where there exist
  resonant and adiabatic directions.
