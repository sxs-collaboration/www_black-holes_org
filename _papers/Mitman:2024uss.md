abstract: |
  Gravitational memory effects and the BMS freedoms exhibited at
  future null infinity have recently been resolved and utilized in
  numerical relativity simulations. With this, gravitational wave
  models and our understanding of the fundamental nature of general
  relativity have been vastly improved. In this paper, we review the
  history and intuition behind memory effects and BMS symmetries, how
  they manifest in gravitational waves, and how controlling the
  infinite number of BMS freedoms of numerical relativity simulations
  can crucially improve the waveform models that are used by
  gravitational wave detectors. We reiterate the fact that, with
  memory effects and BMS symmetries, not only can these next-
  generation numerical waveforms be used to observe never-before-seen
  physics, but they can also be used to test GR and learn new
  astrophysical information about our Universe.
