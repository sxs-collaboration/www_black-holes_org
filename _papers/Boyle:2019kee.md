  Accurate models of gravitational waves from merging black holes are
  necessary for detectors to observe as many events as possible while
  extracting the maximum science. Near the time of merger, the
  gravitational waves from merging black holes can be computed only
  using numerical relativity. In this paper, we present a major update
  of the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS) Collaboration catalog of
  numerical simulations for merging black holes. The catalog contains
  2018 distinct configurations (a factor of 11 increase compared to
  the 2013 SXS catalog), including 1426 spin-precessing
  configurations, with mass ratios between 1 and 10, and spin
  magnitudes up to 0.998. The median length of a waveform in the
  catalog is 39 cycles of the dominant gravitational-wave mode, with
  the shortest waveform containing 7.0 cycles and the longest 351.3
  cycles. We discuss improvements such as correcting for moving
  centers of mass and extended coverage of the parameter space. We
  also present a thorough analysis of numerical errors, finding
  typical truncation errors corresponding to a waveform mismatch
  of  ∼10−4. The simulations provide remnant masses and spins with
  uncertainties of 0.03% and 0.1% (90th percentile), about an order of
  magnitude better than analytical models for remnant properties. The
  full catalog is publicly available at www.black-holes.org/waveforms.
