  Providing an accurate modeling of neutrino physics in dense
  astrophysical environments such as binary neutron star mergers
  presents a challenge for hydrodynamic simulations. Nevertheless,
  understanding how flavor transformation can occur and affect the
  dynamics, the mass ejection, and the nucleosynthesis will need to be
  achieved in the future. Computationally expensive, large-scale
  simulations frequently evolve the first classical angular moments of
  the neutrino distributions. By promoting these quantities to
  matrices in flavor space, we develop a linear stability analysis of
  fast flavor oscillations using only the first two “quantum” moments,
  which notably requires generalizing the classical closure relations
  that appropriately truncate the hierarchy of moment equations in
  order to treat quantum flavor coherence. After showing the
  efficiency of this method on a well-understood test situation, we
  perform a systematic search of the occurrence of fast flavor
  instabilities in a neutron star merger simulation. We discuss the
  successes and shortcomings of moment linear stability analysis, as
  this framework provides a time-efficient way to design and study
  better closure prescriptions in the future.
