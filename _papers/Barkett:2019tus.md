  The tidal deformations of neutron stars within an inspiraling
  compact binary alter the orbital dynamics, imprinting a signature on
  the gravitational wave signal. Modeling this signal could be done
  with numerical-relativity simulations, but these are too
  computationally expensive for many applications. Analytic post-
  Newtonian treatments are limited by unknown higher-order nontidal
  terms. This paper further builds upon the “tidal splicing” model in
  which post-Newtonian tidal terms are “spliced” onto numerical
  relativity simulations of black-hole binaries. We improve on
  previous treatments of tidal splicing by including spherical
  harmonic modes beyond the (2,2) mode, expanding the post-Newtonian
  expressions for tidal effects to 2.5 order, including dynamical tide
  corrections, and adding a partial treatment of the spin-tidal
  dynamics. Furthermore, instead of numerical relativity simulations,
  we use the spin-aligned binary black hole (BBH) surrogate model
  “NRHybSur3dq8” to provide the BBH waveforms that are input into the
  tidal slicing procedure. This allows us to construct spin-aligned,
  inspiraling TaylorT2 and TaylorT4 splicing waveform models that can
  be evaluated quickly. These models are tested against existing
  binary neutron star and black hole–neutron star simulations. We
  implement the TaylorT2 splicing model as an extension to
  “NRHybSur3dq8,” creating a model that we call “NRHybSur3dq8Tidal.”
