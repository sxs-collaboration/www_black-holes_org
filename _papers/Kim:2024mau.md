  Relativistic plasmas around compact objects can sometimes be
  approximated as being force-free. In this limit, the plasma inertia
  is negligible and the overall dynamics is governed by global
  electric currents. We present a novel numerical approach for
  simulating such force-free plasmas, which allows for high accuracy
  in smooth regions as well as capturing dissipation in current
  sheets. Using a high-order accurate discontinuous Galerkin method
  augmented with a conservative finite-difference method, we
  demonstrate efficient global simulations of black hole and neutron
  star magnetospheres. In addition to a series of challenging test
  problems, we show that our approach can—depending on the physical
  properties of the system and the numerical implementation—be up to
  \(10x\) more efficient than conventional simulations, with a speedup of
  \(2-3x\) for most problems we consider in practice.
