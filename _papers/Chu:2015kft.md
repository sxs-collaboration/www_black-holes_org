  We present a new set of 95 numerical relativity simulations of non-
  precessing binary black holes (BBHs). The simulations sample
  comprehensively both black-hole spins up to spin magnitude of 0.9,
  and cover mass ratios 1â€“3. The simulations cover on average 24
  inspiral orbits, plus merger and ringdown, with low initial orbital
  eccentricities \(e\lt {10}^{-4}\). A subset of the simulations extends
  the coverage of non-spinning BBHs up to mass ratio q = 10.
  Gravitational waveforms at asymptotic infinity are computed with two
  independent techniques: extrapolation and Cauchy characteristic
  extraction. An error analysis based on noise-weighted inner products
  is performed. We find that numerical truncation error, error due to
  gravitational wave extraction, and errors due to the Fourier
  transformation of signals with finite length of the numerical
  waveforms are of similar magnitude, with gravitational wave
  extraction errors dominating at noise-weighted mismatches of \(\sim
  3\times {10}^{-4}\). This set of waveforms will serve to validate and
  improve aligned-spin waveform models for gravitational wave science.
