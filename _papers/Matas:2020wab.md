  After the discovery of gravitational waves from binary black holes
  (BBHs) and binary neutron stars (BNSs) with the LIGO and Virgo
  detectors, neutron-star black holes (NSBHs) are the natural next
  class of binary systems to be observed. In this work, we develop a
  waveform model for aligned-spin NSBHs combining a BBH baseline
  waveform (available in the effective-one-body approach) with a
  phenomenological description of tidal effects (extracted from
  numerical-relativity simulations) and correcting the amplitude
  during the late inspiral, merger and ringdown to account for the NS
  tidal disruption. In particular, we calibrate the amplitude
  corrections using NSBH waveforms obtained with the numerical-
  relativity spectral Einstein code (spec) and the sacra code. The
  model was calibrated using simulations with NS masses in the range
  1.2–1.4  M⊙, tidal deformabilities up to 4200 (for a 1.2  M⊙ NS),
  and dimensionless BH spin magnitude up to 0.9. Based on the
  simulations used and on checking that sensible waveforms are
  produced, we recommend our model to be employed with a NS mass in
  the range 1–3  M⊙, tidal deformability 0–5000, and (dimensionless)
  BH spin magnitude up to 0.9. We also validate our model against two
  new, highly accurate NSBH waveforms with BH spin 0.9 and mass ratios
  3 and 4, characterized by tidal disruption, produced with SpEC, and
  find very good agreement. Furthermore, we compute the unfaithfulness
  between waveforms from NSBH, BBH, and BNS systems, finding that it
  will be challenging for the Advanced LIGO-Virgo detector network at
  design sensitivity to distinguish different source classes. We
  perform a Bayesian parameter-estimation analysis on a synthetic
  numerical-relativity signal in zero noise to study parameter biases.
  Finally, we reanalyze GW170817, with the hypothesis that it is a
  NSBH. We do not find evidence to distinguish the BNS and NSBH
  hypotheses; however, the posterior for the mass ratio is shifted to
  less equal masses under the NSBH hypothesis.
