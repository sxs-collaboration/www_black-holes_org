  Gravitational waveforms from numerical simulations are a critical
  tool to test and analytically calibrate the waveform models used to
  study the properties of merging compact objects. In this paper, we
  present a series of high-accuracy waveforms produced with the
  spectral Einstein code (SpEC) for systems involving at least one
  neutron star. We provide for the first time waveforms with subradian
  accuracy over more than twenty cycles for low-mass black hole-
  neutron star binaries, including binaries with nonspinning objects,
  and binaries with rapidly spinning neutron stars that maximize the
  impact on the gravitational wave signal of the near-resonant growth
  of the fundamental excitation mode of the neutron star (f-mode). We
  also provide for the first time with SpEC a high-accuracy neutron
  star-neutron star waveform. These waveforms are made publicly
  available as part of the SxS catalogue. We compare our results to
  analytical waveform models currently implemented in data analysis
  pipelines. For most simulations, the models lie outside of the
  predicted numerical errors in the last few orbits before merger, but
  do not show systematic deviations from the numerical results:
  comparing different models appears to provide reasonable estimates
  of the modeling errors. The sole exception is the equal-mass
  simulation using a rapidly counterrotating neutron star to maximize
  the impact of the excitation of the f-mode, for which all models
  perform poorly. This is however expected, as even the single model
  that takes f-mode excitation into account ignores the significant
  impact of the neutron star spin on the f-mode excitation frequency.
