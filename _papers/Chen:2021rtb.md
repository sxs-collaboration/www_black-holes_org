  We present a new choice of initial data for binary black hole
  simulations that significantly improves the efficiency of high-spin
  simulations. We use spherical Kerr-Schild coordinates, where the
  horizon of a rotating black hole is spherical, for each black hole.
  The superposed spherical Kerr-Schild initial data reduce the runtime
  by a factor of 2 compared to standard superposed Kerr-Schild for an
  intermediate resolution spin-0.99 binary-black-hole simulation. We
  also explore different variations of the gauge conditions imposed
  during the evolution, one of which produces an additional speed-up
  of 1.3.
