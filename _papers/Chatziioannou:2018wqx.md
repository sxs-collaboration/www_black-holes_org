  Characterizing the properties of black holes is one of the most
  important science objectives for gravitational-wave observations.
  Astrophysical evidence suggests that black holes that are nearly
  extremal (i.e., spins near the theoretical upper limit) might exist
  and, thus, might be among the merging black holes observed with
  gravitational waves. In this paper, we explore how well current
  gravitational wave parameter estimation methods can measure the
  spins of rapidly spinning black holes in binaries. We simulate
  gravitational-wave signals using numerical-relativity waveforms for
  nearly-extremal, merging black holes. For simplicity, we confine our
  attention to binaries with spins parallel or antiparallel with the
  orbital angular momentum. We find that recovering the holes’ nearly
  extremal spins is challenging. When the spins are nearly extremal
  and parallel to each other, the resulting parameter estimates do
  recover spins that are large, though the recovered spin magnitudes
  are still significantly smaller than the true spin magnitudes. When
  the spins are nearly extremal and antiparallel to each other, the
  resulting parameter estimates recover the small effective spin but
  incorrectly estimate the individual spins as nearly zero. We study
  the effect of spin priors and argue that a commonly used prior
  (uniform in spin magnitude and direction) hinders unbiased recovery
  of large black-hole spins.
