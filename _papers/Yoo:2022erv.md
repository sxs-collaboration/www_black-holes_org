  Gravitational wave observations of large mass ratio compact binary
  mergers like GW190814 highlight the need for reliable, high-accuracy
  waveform templates for such systems. We present nrhybsur2dq15, a new
  surrogate model trained on hybridized numerical relativity (NR)
  waveforms with mass ratios <math
  display="inline"><mi>q</mi><mo>≤</mo><mn>15</mn></math> and aligned
  spins |χ1z|≤0.5 and χ2z=0. We target the parameter space of
  GW190814-like events as large mass ratio NR simulations are very
  expensive. The model includes the (2, 2), (2, 1), (3, 3), (4, 4),
  and (5, 5) spin-weighted spherical harmonic modes and spans the
  entire LIGO-Virgo bandwidth (with <math display="inline"><msub><mi>f
  </mi><mi>low</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>20</mn><mtext> </mtext><mtext>
   </mtext><mi>Hz</mi></math>) for total masses M≳9.5M⊙. nrhybsur2dq15
  accurately reproduces the hybrid waveforms, with mismatches below
  ∼2×10<sup>-3</sup> for total masses
  10M⊙≤M≤300M⊙. This is at
  least an order of magnitude improvement over existing semianalytical
  models for GW190814-like systems. Finally, we reanalyze GW190814
  with the new model and obtain source parameter constraints
  consistent with previous work.
