  We give full details regarding the new Cauchy-characteristic
  evolution (CCE) system in spectre. The implementation is built to
  provide streamlined flexibility for either extracting waveforms
  during the process of a spectre binary compact object simulation or
  as a stand-alone module for extracting waveforms from worldtube data
  provided by another code base. Using our recently presented improved
  analytic formulation, the CCE system is free of pure-gauge
  logarithms that would spoil the spectral convergence of the scheme.
  It gracefully extracts all five Weyl scalars, in addition to the
  news and the strain. The spectre CCE system makes significant
  improvements on previous implementations in modularity, ease of use,
  and speed of computation.
