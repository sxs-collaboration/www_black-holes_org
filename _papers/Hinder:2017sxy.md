  We present a prescription for computing gravitational waveforms for
  the inspiral, merger and ringdown of nonspinning moderately
  eccentric binary black hole systems. The inspiral waveform is
  computed using the post-Newtonian expansion and the merger waveform
  is computed by interpolating a small number of quasicircular NR
  waveforms. The use of circular merger waveforms is possible because
  binaries with moderate eccentricity circularize in the last few
  cycles before the merger, which we demonstrate up to mass ratio
  q=m1/m2=3. The complete model is calibrated to 23 numerical
  relativity (NR) simulations starting ≈20 cycles before the merger
  with eccentricities eref≤0.1 and mass ratios q≤3, where eref is the
  eccentricity ≈7 cycles before the merger. The NR waveforms are long
  enough that they start below 30 Hz (10 Hz) for BBH systems with
  total mass M≥80  M⊙ (230  M⊙). We find that, for the sensitivity of
  advanced LIGO at the time of its first observing run, the eccentric
  model has a faithfulness with NR of over 97% for systems with total
  mass M≥85M⊙ across the parameter space (eref≤0.1, q≤3). For systems
  with total mass M≥70M⊙, the faithfulness is over 97% for eref≲0.05
  and q≤3. The NR waveforms and the Mathematica code for the model are
  publicly available.
