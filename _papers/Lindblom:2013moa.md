  This paper develops a method for solving Einstein's equation
  numerically on multicube representations of manifolds with arbitrary
  spatial topologies. This method is designed to provide a set of
  flexible, easy to use computational procedures that make it possible
  to explore the never before studied properties of solutions to
  Einstein's equation on manifolds with arbitrary toplogical
  structures. A new covariant, first-order symmetric-hyperbolic
  representation of Einstein's equation is developed for this
  purpose, along with the needed boundary conditions at the interfaces
  between adjoining cubic regions. Numerical tests are presented that
  demonstrate the long-term numerical stability of this method for
  evolutions of a complicated, time-dependent solution of
  Einstein's equation coupled to a complex scalar field on a
  manifold with spatial topology \({S}^{3}\). The accuracy of these
  numerical test solutions is evaluated by performing convergence
  studies and by comparing the full nonlinear numerical results to the
  analytical perturbation solutions, which are also derived here.
