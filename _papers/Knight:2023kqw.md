  In numerical simulations of binary neutron star systems, the
  equation of state of the dense neutron star matter is an important
  factor in determining both the physical realism and the numerical
  accuracy of the simulations. Some equations of state used in
  simulations are <math
  display="inline"><msup><mi>C</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></math> or
  smoother in the pressure/density relationship function, such as a
  polytropic equation of state, but may not have the flexibility to
  model stars or remnants of different masses while keeping their
  radii within known astrophysical constraints. Other equations of
  state, such as tabular or piecewise polytropic, may be flexible
  enough to model additional physics and multiple stars’ masses and
  radii within known constraints, but are not as smooth, resulting in
  additional numerical error. We will study in this paper a recently
  developed family of equation of state, using a spectral expansion
  with sufficient free parameters to allow for a larger flexibility
  than current polytropic equations of state, and with sufficient
  smoothness to reduce numerical errors compared to tabulated or
  piecewise polytropic equations of state. We perform simulations at
  three mass ratios with a common chirp mass, using two distinct
  spectral equations of state, and at multiple numerical resolutions.
  We evaluate the gravitational waves produced from these simulations,
  comparing the phase error between resolutions and equations of
  state, as well as with respect to analytical models. From our
  simulations, we estimate that the phase difference at the merger for
  binaries with a dimensionless weighted tidal deformability
  difference greater than <math display="inline"><mi
  mathvariant="normal">Δ</mi><mover accent="true"><mi
  mathvariant="normal">Λ</mi><mo
  stretchy="false">˜</mo></mover><mo>≈</mo><mn>55</mn></math> can be
  captured by the spectral Einstein code for these equations of state.
