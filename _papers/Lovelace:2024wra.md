  Binary black holes are the most abundant source of gravitational-
  wave observations. Gravitational-wave observatories in the next
  decade will require tremendous increases in the accuracy of
  numerical waveforms modeling binary black holes, compared to today’s
  state of the art. One approach to achieving the required accuracy is
  using spectral-type methods that scale to many processors. Using the
  SpECTRE numerical-relativity (NR) code, we present the first
  simulations of a binary black hole inspiral, merger, and ringdown
  using discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods. The efficiency of DG
  methods allows us to evolve the binary through ∼ 18 orbits at
  reasonable computational cost. We then use SpECTRE’s Cauchy
  Characteristic Evolution (CCE) code to extract the gravitational
  waves at future null infinity. The open-source nature of SpECTRE
  means this is the first time a spectral-type method for simulating
  binary black hole evolutions is available to the entire NR
  community.
