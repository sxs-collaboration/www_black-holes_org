  The merger of a black hole (BH) and a neutron star (NS) in most
  cases is expected to leave no material around the remnant BH;
  therefore, such events are often considered as sources of
  gravitational waves without electromagnetic counterparts. However, a
  bright counterpart can emerge if the NS is strongly magnetized, as
  its external magnetosphere can experience radiative shocks and
  magnetic reconnection during/after the merger. We use
  magnetohydrodynamic simulations in the dynamical spacetime of a
  merging BH-NS binary to investigate its magnetospheric dynamics. We
  find that the magnetosphere develops compressive waves that steepen
  into shocks. After swallowing the NS, the BH acquires a
  magnetosphere that quickly evolves into a split monopole
  configuration and then undergoes an exponential decay (balding),
  enabled by magnetic reconnection and also assisted by the ring-down
  of the remnant BH. This spinning BH drags the split monopole into
  rotation, forming a transient pulsar-like state. It emits a striped
  wind if the swallowed magnetic dipole moment is inclined to the spin
  axis. We predict two types of transients from this scenario: (1) a
  fast radio burst emitted by the shocks as they expand to large radii
  and (2) an X/gamma-ray burst emitted by the $e^\pm$ outflow heated
  by magnetic dissipation.
