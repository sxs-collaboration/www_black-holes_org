  Highly precise and robust waveform models are required as
  improvements in detector sensitivity enable us to test general
  relativity with more precision than ever before. In this work, we
  introduce a spin-aligned surrogate ringdown model. This ringdown
  surrogate, NRSur3dq8_RD, is built with numerical waveforms produced
  using Cauchy-characteristic evolution. In addition, these waveforms
  are in the superrest frame of the remnant black hole allowing us to
  do a correct analysis of the ringdown spectrum. The novel prediction
  of our surrogate model is complex-valued quasinormal mode (QNM)
  amplitudes, with median relative errors of $10^{-2}-10^{-3}$ over
  the parameter space. Like previous remnant surrogates, we also
  predict the remnant black hole's mass and spin. The QNM mode
  amplitude errors translate into median errors on ringdown waveforms
  of $10^{-4}$. The high accuracy and QNM mode content provided by our
  surrogate will enable high-precision ringdown analyses such as tests
  of general relativity. Our ringdown model is publicly available
  through the python package surfinBH.
