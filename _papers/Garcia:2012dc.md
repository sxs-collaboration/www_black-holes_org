  Initial data for numerical evolutions of binary-black holes have
  been dominated by 'conformally flat' (CF) data (i.e., initial data
  where the conformal background metric is chosen to be flat) because
  they are easy to construct. However, CF initial data cannot simulate
  nearly extremal spins, while more complicated 'conformally curved'
  initial data (i.e., initial data in which the background metric is
  \emph{not} explicitly chosen to be flat), such as initial data where
  the spatial metric is chosen to be proportional to a weighted
  superposition of two Kerr-Schild (SKS) black holes can. Here we
  establish the consistency between the astrophysical results of these
  two initial data schemes for nonspinning binary systems. We evolve
  the inspiral, merger, and ringdown of two equal-mass, nonspinning
  black holes using SKS initial data and compare with an analogous
  simulation using CF initial data. We find that the resultant
  gravitational-waveform phases agree to within \(\delta \phi \lesssim
  10^{-2}\) radians and the amplitudes agree to within \(\delta A/A
  \lesssim 5 \times 10^{-3}\), which are within the numerical errors of
  the simulations. Furthermore, we find that the final mass and spin
  of the remnant black hole agree to one part in \(10^{5}\).
