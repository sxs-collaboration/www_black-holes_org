  The main problems of nonvacuum numerical relativity, compact binary
  mergers and stellar collapse, involve hydromagnetic instabilities
  and turbulent flows, so that kinetic energy at small scales leads to
  mean effects at large scale that drive the secular evolution.
  Notable among these effects is momentum transport. We investigate
  two models of this transport effect, a relativistic Navier-Stokes
  system and a turbulent mean stress model, that are similar to all of
  the prescriptions that have been attempted to date for treating
  subgrid effects on binary neutron star mergers and their aftermath.
  Our investigation involves both stability analysis and numerical
  experimentation on star and disk systems. We also begin the
  investigation of the effects of particle and heat transport on
  postmerger simulations. We find that correct handling of turbulent
  heating is crucial for avoiding unphysical instabilities. Given such
  appropriate handling, the evolution of a differentially rotating
  star and the accretion rate of a disk are reassuringly insensitive
  to the choice of prescription. However, disk outflows can be
  sensitive to the choice of method, even for the same effective
  viscous strength. We also consider the effects of eddy diffusion in
  the evolution of an accretion disk and show that it can
  interestingly affect the composition of outflows.
