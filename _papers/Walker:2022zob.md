  Numerical relativity (NR) simulations of binary black hole (BBH)
  systems provide the most accurate gravitational wave predictions,
  but at a high computational cost—especially when the black holes
  have nearly extremal spins (i.e. spins near the theoretical upper
  limit) or very unequal masses. Recently, the technique of reduced
  order modeling has enabled the construction of ‘surrogate models’
  trained on an existing set of NR waveforms. Surrogate models enable
  the rapid computation of the gravitational waves emitted by BBHs.
  Typically these models are used for interpolation to compute
  gravitational waveforms for BBHs with mass ratios and spins within
  the bounds of the training set. Because simulations with nearly
  extremal spins are so technically challenging, surrogate models
  almost always rely on training sets with only moderate spins. In
  this paper, we explore how well surrogate models can extrapolate to
  nearly extremal spins when the training set only includes moderate
  spins. For simplicity, we focus on one-dimensional surrogate models
  trained on NR simulations of BBHs with equal masses and equal,
  aligned spins. We assess the performance of the surrogate models at
  higher spin magnitudes by calculating the mismatches between
  extrapolated surrogate model waveforms and NR waveforms, by
  calculating the differences between extrapolated and NR measurements
  of the remnant black-hole mass, and by testing how the surrogate
  model improves as the training set extends to higher spins. We find
  that while extrapolation in this one-dimensional case is viable for
  current detector sensitivities, surrogate models for next-generation
  detectors should use training sets that extend to nearly extremal
  spins.
