  Cauchy-characteristic evolution (CCE) is a powerful method for
  accurately extracting gravitational waves at future null infinity.
  In this work, we extend the previously implemented CCE system within
  the numerical relativity code SpECTRE by incorporating a scalar
  field. This allows the system to capture features of beyond-general-
  relativity theories. We derive scalar contributions to the equations
  of motion, Weyl scalar computations, Bianchi identities, and balance
  laws at future null infinity. Our algorithm, tested across various
  scenarios, accurately reveals memory effects induced by both scalar
  and tensor fields and captures Price's power-law tail (\(u^{-l-2}\))
  in scalar fields at future null infinity, in contrast to the
  \(t^{-2l-3}\) tail at future timelike infinity.
