  A variety of high-energy astrophysical phenomena are powered by the
  release -- via magnetic reconnection -- of the energy stored in
  oppositely directed fields. Single-fluid resistive
  magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with uniform resistivity yield
  dissipation rates that are much lower (by nearly one order of
  magnitude) than equivalent kinetic calculations. Reconnection-driven
  phenomena could be accordingly modeled in resistive MHD employing a
  non-uniform, ``effective'' resistivity informed by kinetic
  calculations. In this work, we analyze a suite of fully kinetic
  particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of relativistic pair-plasma
  reconnection -- where the magnetic energy is greater than the rest
  mass energy -- for different strengths of the guide field orthogonal
  to the alternating component. We extract an empirical prescription
  for the effective resistivity, $\eta_{\mathrm{eff}} = \alpha B_0
  \mathbf{|J|}^p / \left(|\mathbf{J}|^{p+1}+\left(e n_t
  c\right)^{p+1}\right)$, where $B_0$ is the reconnecting magnetic
  field strength, $\bf J$ is the current density, $n_t$ the lab-frame
  total number density, $e$ the elementary charge, and $c$ the speed
  of light. The guide field dependence is encoded in $\alpha$ and $p$,
  which we fit to PIC data. This resistivity formulation -- which
  relies only on single-fluid MHD quantities -- successfully
  reproduces the spatial structure and strength of nonideal electric
  fields, and thus provides a promising strategy for enhancing the
  reconnection rate in resistive MHD simulations.
