  A variety of high-energy astrophysical phenomena are powered by the
  release—via magnetic reconnection—of the energy stored in oppositely
  directed fields. Single-fluid resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
  simulations with uniform resistivity yield dissipation rates that
  are much lower (by nearly 1 order of magnitude) than equivalent
  kinetic calculations. Reconnection-driven phenomena could be
  accordingly modeled in resistive MHD employing a nonuniform,
  “effective” resistivity informed by kinetic calculations. In this
  work, we analyze a suite of fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC)
  simulations of relativistic pair-plasma reconnection—where the
  magnetic energy is greater than the rest mass energy—for different
  strengths of the guide field orthogonal to the alternating
  component. We extract an empirical prescription for the effective
  resistivity, ηeff=αB0∣J∣p/∣J∣p+1+entcp+1, where B$_{0}$ is the
  reconnecting magnetic field strength, J is the current density,
  n$_{t}$ is the lab-frame total number density, e is the elementary
  charge, and c is the speed of light. The guide field dependence is
  encoded in α and p, which we fit to PIC data. This resistivity
  formulation—which relies only on single-fluid MHD
  quantities—successfully reproduces the spatial structure and
  strength of nonideal electric fields and thus provides a promising
  strategy for enhancing the reconnection rate in resistive MHD
  simulations.
