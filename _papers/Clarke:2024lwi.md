  The ringdown portion of a binary black hole merger consists of a sum
  of modes, each containing an infinite number of tones that are
  exponentially damped sinusoids. In principle, these can be measured
  as gravitational-waves with observatories like LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA,
  however in practice it is unclear how many tones can be meaningfully
  resolved. We investigate the consistency and resolvability of the
  overtones of the quadrupolar ℓ=m=2 mode by starting at late
  times when the gravitational waveform is expected to be well
  approximated by the ℓmn=220 tone alone. We present a Bayesian
  inference framework to measure the tones in numerical relativity
  data. We measure tones at different start times, checking for
  consistency: we classify a tone as stably recovered if and only if
  the 95% credible intervals for amplitude and phase at time t
  overlap with the credible
  intervals at all subsequent times. We test a set of tones including
  the first four overtones of the fundamental mode and the 320 tone
  and find that the 220 and 221 tones can be measured consistently
  with the inclusion of additional overtones. The 222 tone
  measurements can be stabilized when we include the 223 tone, but
  only in a narrow time window, after which it is too weak to measure.
  The 223 tone recovery appears to be unstable, and does not become
  stable with the introduction of the 224 tone. We find that N=3
  tones can be
  stably recovered simultaneously. However, when analyzing
  N≥4 tones, the
  amplitude of one tone is consistent with zero. Thus, within our
  framework, one can identify only N=3 tones with
  nonzero amplitude that are simultaneously stable.
