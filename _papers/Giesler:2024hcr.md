abstract: |
  Using high-accuracy numerical relativity waveforms, we confirm the
  presence of numerous overtones of the \(\ell=2\), \(m=2\) quasinormal
  mode early in the ringdown of binary black hole mergers. We do this
  by demonstrating the stability of the mode amplitudes at different
  fit times, ruling out the possibility that a linear superposition of
  modes unphysically fits a highly nonlinear part of the waveform. We
  also find a number of previously unidentified subdominant second-
  order quasinormal modes in the $(2,2)$ mode. Even though these modes
  are mathematically nonlinear, they nevertheless confirm the validity
  of perturbation theory as a good approximation for describing much
  of the ringdown.
