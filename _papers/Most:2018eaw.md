  Merging binaries of neutron-stars are not only strong sources of
  gravitational waves, but also have the potential of revealing states
  of matter at densities and temperatures not accessible in
  laboratories. A crucial and long-standing question in this context
  is whether quarks are deconfined as a result of the dramatic
  increase in density and temperature following the merger. We present
  the first fully general-relativistic simulations of merging neutron-
  stars including quarks at finite temperatures that can be switched
  off consistently in the equation of state. Within our approach, we
  can determine clearly what signatures a quark-hadron phase
  transition would leave in the gravitational-wave signal. We show
  that if after the merger the conditions are met for a phase
  transition to take place at several times nuclear saturation
  density, they would lead to a postmerger signal considerably
  different from the one expected from the inspiral, that can only
  probe the hadronic part of the equations of state, and to an
  anticipated collapse of the merged object. We also show that the
  phase transition leads to a very hot and dense quark core that, when
  it collapses to a black hole, produces a ringdown signal different
  from the hadronic one. Finally, in analogy with what is done in
  heavy-ion collisions, we use the evolution of the temperature and
  density in the merger remnant to illustrate the properties of the
  phase transition in a QCD phase diagram.
