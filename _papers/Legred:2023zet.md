  Numerical simulations of neutron star mergers represent an essential
  step toward interpreting the full complexity of multimessenger
  observations and constraining the properties of supranuclear matter.
  Currently, simulations are limited by an array of factors, including
  computational performance and input physics uncertainties, such as
  the neutron star equation of state. In this work, we expand the
  range of nuclear phenomenology efficiently available to simulations
  by introducing a new analytic parametrization of cold, beta-
  equilibrated matter that is based on the relativistic enthalpy. We
  show that the new enthalpy parametrization can capture a range of
  nuclear behavior, including strong phase transitions. We implement
  the enthalpy parametrization in the spectre code, simulate isolated
  neutron stars, and compare performance to the commonly used spectral
  and polytropic parametrizations. We find comparable computational
  performance for nuclear models that are well represented by either
  parametrization, such as simple hadronic equations of state. We show
  that the enthalpy parametrization further allows us to simulate more
  complicated hadronic models or models with phase transitions that
  are inaccessible to current parametrizations.
