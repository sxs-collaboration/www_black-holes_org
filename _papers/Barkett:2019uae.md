  We present an improved spectral algorithm for Cauchy-characteristic
  extraction and characteristic evolution of gravitational waves in
  numerical relativity. The new algorithms improve spectral
  convergence both at the poles of the spherical-polar grid and at
  future null infinity, as well as increase the temporal resolution of
  the code. The key to the success of these algorithms is a new set of
  high-accuracy tests, which we present here. We demonstrate the
  accuracy of the code and compare with the existing pittnull
  implementation.
