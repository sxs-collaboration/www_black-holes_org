  As gravitational-wave detectors become more sensitive and broaden
  their frequency bandwidth, we will access a greater variety of
  signals emitted by compact binary systems, shedding light on their
  astrophysical origin and environment. A key physical effect that can
  distinguish among different formation scenarios is the misalignment
  of the spins with the orbital angular momentum, causing the spins
  and the binary’s orbital plane to precess. To accurately model such
  precessing signals, especially when masses and spins vary in the
  wide astrophysical range, it is crucial to include multipoles beyond
  the dominant quadrupole. Here, we develop the first multipolar
  precessing waveform model in the effective-one-body (EOB) formalism
  for the entire coalescence stage (i.e., inspiral, merger and
  ringdown) of binary black holes: SEOBNRv4PHM. In the nonprecessing
  limit, the model reduces to SEOBNRv4HM, which was calibrated to
  numerical-relativity (NR) simulations, and waveforms from black-hole
  perturbation theory. We validate SEOBNRv4PHM by comparing it to the
  public catalog of 1405 precessing NR waveforms of the Simulating
  eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS) collaboration, and also to 118 SXS
  precessing NR waveforms, produced as part of this project, which
  span mass ratios 1-4 and (dimensionless) black-hole’s spins up to
  0.9. We stress that SEOBNRv4PHM is not calibrated to NR simulations
  in the precessing sector. We compute the unfaithfulness against the
  1523 SXS precessing NR waveforms, and find that, for 94% (57%) of
  the cases, the maximum value, in the total mass range 20−200  M⊙, is
  below 3% (1%). Those numbers change to 83% (20%) when using the
  inspiral-merger-ringdown, multipolar, precessing phenomenological
  model IMRPhenomPv3HM. We investigate the impact of such
  unfaithfulness values with two Bayesian, parameter-estimation
  studies on synthetic signals. We also compute the unfaithfulness
  between those waveform models as a function of the mass and spin
  parameters to identify in which part of the parameter space they
  differ the most. We validate them also against the multipolar,
  precessing NR surrogate model NRSur7dq4, and find that the
  SEOBNRv4PHM model outperforms IMRPhenomPv3HM.
