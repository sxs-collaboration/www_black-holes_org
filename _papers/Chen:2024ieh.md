  Numerical relativists can now produce gravitational waveforms with
  memory effects routinely and accurately. The gravitational-wave
  memory effect contains very low-frequency components, including a
  persistent offset. The presence of these components violates basic
  assumptions about time-shift behavior underpinning standard data-
  analysis techniques in gravitational-wave astronomy. This poses a
  challenge to the analysis of waveform spectra: how to preserve the
  low-frequency characteristics when transforming a time-domain
  waveform to the frequency domain. To tackle this challenge, we
  revisit the preprocessing procedures applied to the waveforms that
  contain memory effects. We find inconsistency between the zero-
  frequency limit of displacement memory and the low-frequency
  spectrum of the same memory preprocessed using the common scheme in
  literature. To resolve the inconsistency, we propose a new robust
  preprocessing scheme that produces the spectra of memory waveforms
  more faithfully. Using this new scheme, we inspect several
  characteristics of the spectrum of a memory waveform. In particular,
  we find a discernible beating pattern formed by the dominant
  oscillatory mode and the displacement memory. This pattern is absent
  in the spectrum of a waveform without memory. The difference between
  the memory and no-memory waveforms is too small to be observed by
  current-generation detectors in a single binary-black-hole event.
  Detecting the memory in a single event is likely to occur in the era
  of next-generation detectors.
