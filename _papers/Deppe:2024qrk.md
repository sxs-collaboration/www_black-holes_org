  We assess the prospects for detecting gravitational wave echoes
  arising due to the quantum nature of black hole horizons with LISA.
  In a recent proposal, Bekenstein's black hole area quantization is
  connected to a discrete absorption spectrum for black holes in the
  context of gravitational radiation. Consequently, for incoming
  radiation at the black hole horizon, not all frequencies are
  absorbed, raising the possibility that the unabsorbed radiation is
  reflected, producing an echo-like signal closely following the
  binary coalescence waveform. In this work, we further develop this
  proposal by introducing a robust, phenomenologically motivated model
  for black hole reflectivity. Using this model, we calculate the
  resulting echoes for an ensemble of Numerical Relativity waveforms
  and examine their detectability with the LISA space-based
  interferometer. Our analysis demonstrates promising detection
  prospects and shows that, upon detection, LISA provides a direct
  probe of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. In addition, we find that
  the information extractable from LISA data offers valuable
  constraints on a wide range of quantum gravity theories.
