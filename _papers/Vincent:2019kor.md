  We present 12 new simulations of unequal mass neutron star mergers.
  The simulations are performed with the spec code, and utilize
  nuclear-theory-based equations of state and a two-moment gray
  neutrino transport scheme with an improved energy estimate based on
  evolving the number density. We model the neutron stars with the
  SFHo, LS220, and DD2 equations of state (EOS) and we study the
  neutrino and matter emission of all 12 models to search for robust
  trends between binary parameters and emission characteristics. We
  find that the total mass of the dynamical ejecta exceeds 0.01  M⊙
  only for SFHo with weak dependence on the mass ratio across all
  models. We find that the ejecta have a broad electron fraction (Ye)
  distribution (≈0.06–0.48), with mean 0.2. Ye increases with neutrino
  irradiation over time, but decreases with increasing binary
  asymmetry. We also find that the models have ejecta with a broad
  asymptotic velocity distribution (≈0.05–0.7c). The average velocity
  lies in the range 0.2c-0.3c and decreases with binary asymmetry.
  Furthermore, we find that disk mass increases with binary asymmetry
  and stiffness of the EOS. The Ye of the disk increases with softness
  of the EOS. The strongest neutrino emission occurs for the models
  with soft EOS. For (anti) electron neutrinos we find no significant
  dependence of the magnitude or angular distribution or neutrino
  luminosity with mass ratio. The heavier neutrino species have a
  luminosity dependence on mass ratio but an angular distribution
  which does not change with mass ratio.
