  We propose a new approach toward reconstructing the late-time near-
  horizon geometry of merging binary black holes, and toward computing
  gravitational-wave echoes from exotic compact objects. A binary
  black-hole merger spacetime can be divided by a timelike
  hypersurface into a black-hole perturbation (BHP) region (in which
  the spacetime geometry can be approximated by homogeneous linear
  perturbations of the final Kerr black hole) and a nonlinear region.
  At late times, the boundary between the two regions is an infalling
  shell. The BHP region contains late-time gravitational waves emitted
  toward the future horizon, as well as those emitted toward future
  null infinity. In this region, by imposing no-ingoing-wave
  conditions at past null infinity and matching outgoing waves at
  future null infinity with waveforms computed from numerical
  relativity, we can obtain waves that travel toward the future
  horizon. In particular, the Newman-Penrose <math
  display="inline"><msub><mi>ψ</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></math> associated
  with the ingoing wave on the horizon is related to tidal
  deformations measured by fiducial observers floating above the
  horizon. We further determine the boundary of the BHP region on the
  future horizon by imposing that <math
  display="inline"><msub><mi>ψ</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></math> inside the
  BHP region can be faithfully represented by quasinormal modes. Using
  a physically motivated method to impose boundary conditions near the
  horizon and applying the so-called Boltzmann reflectivity, we
  compute the quasinormal modes of nonrotating exotic compact objects,
  as well as gravitational-wave echoes. We also investigate the
  detectability of these echoes in current and future detectors and
  prospects for parameter estimation.
