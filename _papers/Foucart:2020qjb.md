  Gravitational waves and electromagnetic signals from merging neutron
  star binaries provide valuable information about the the properties
  of dense matter, the formation of heavy elements, and high-energy
  astrophysics. To fully leverage observations of these systems, we
  need numerical simulations that provide reliable predictions for the
  properties of the matter unbound in these mergers. An important
  limitation of current simulations is the use of approximate methods
  for neutrino transport that do not converge to a solution of the
  transport equations as numerical resolution increases, and thus have
  errors that are impossible to quantify. Here, we report on a first
  simulation of a binary neutron star merger that uses Monte-Carlo
  techniques to directly solve the transport equations in low-density
  regions. In high-density regions, we use approximations inspired by
  implicit Monte-Carlo to greatly reduce the cost of simulations,
  while only introducing errors quantifiable through more expensive
  convergence studies. We simulate an unequal mass neutron star binary
  merger up to 5 ms past merger, and report on the properties of the
  matter and neutrino outflows. Finally, we compare our results to the
  output of our best approximate “M1” transport scheme, demonstrating
  that an M1 scheme that carefully approximates the neutrino energy
  spectrum only leads to ∼10% uncertainty in the composition and
  velocity of the ejecta, and ∼20% uncertainty in the ν e and
  luminosities and energies. The most significant disagreement found
  between M1 and Monte-Carlo results is a factor of ∼2 difference in
  the luminosity of heavy-lepton neutrinos.
