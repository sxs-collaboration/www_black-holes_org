  We identify various contributors of systematic effects in the
  measurement of the neutron star (NS) tidal deformability and
  quantify their magnitude for several types of neutron star—black
  hole (NSBH) binaries. Gravitational waves from NSBH mergers contain
  information about the components’ masses and spins as well as the NS
  equation of state. Extracting this information requires comparison
  of the signal in noisy detector data with theoretical templates
  derived from some combination of post-Newtonian (PN) approximants,
  effective one-body (EOB) models, and numerical relativity (NR)
  simulations. The accuracy of these templates is limited by errors in
  the NR simulations, by the approximate nature of the PN/EOB
  waveforms, and by the hybridization procedure used to combine them.
  In this paper, we estimate the impact of these errors by
  constructing and comparing a set of PN-NR hybrid waveforms, for the
  first time with NR waveforms from two different codes, namely, SpEC
  and sacra, for such systems. We then attempt to recover the
  parameters of the binary using two non-precessing template
  approximants. As expected, these errors have negligible effect on
  detectability. Mass and spin estimates are moderately affected by
  systematic errors for near equal-mass binaries, while the recovered
  masses can be inaccurate at higher mass ratios. Large uncertainties
  are also found in the tidal deformability Λ, due to differences in
  PN base models used in hybridization, numerical relativity NR
  errors, and inherent limitations of the hybridization method. We
  find that systematic errors are too large for tidal effects to be
  accurately characterized for any realistic NS equation of state
  model. We conclude that NSBH waveform models must be significantly
  improved if they are to be useful for the extraction of NS equation
  of state information or even for distinguishing NSBH systems from
  binary black holes.
