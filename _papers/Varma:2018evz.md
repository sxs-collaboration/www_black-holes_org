  The damped harmonic gauge is important for numerical relativity
  computations based on the generalized harmonic formulation of
  Einsteinâ€™s equations and is used to reduce coordinate distortions
  near binary black hole mergers. However, currently there is no
  prescription to construct quasiequilibrium binary black hole initial
  data in this gauge. Instead, initial data are typically constructed
  using a superposition of two boosted analytic single black hole
  solutions as free data in the solution of the constraint equations.
  Then, a smooth time-dependent gauge transformation is done early in
  the evolution to move into the damped harmonic gauge. Using this
  strategy to produce initial data in the damped harmonic gauge would
  require the solution of a single black hole in this gauge, which is
  not known analytically. In this work we construct a single boosted,
  spinning, equilibrium black hole in damped harmonic coordinates as a
  regular time-independent coordinate transformation from Kerr-Schild
  coordinates. To do this, we derive and solve a set of four coupled,
  nonlinear, elliptic equations for this transformation, with
  appropriate boundary conditions. This solution can now be used in
  the construction of damped harmonic initial data for binary black
  holes.
