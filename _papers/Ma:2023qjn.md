  A fully relativistic three-dimensional Cauchy-characteristic
  matching (CCM) algorithm is implemented for physical degrees of
  freedom in a numerical relativity code spectre. The method is free
  of approximations and can be applied to any physical system. We test
  the algorithm with various scenarios involving smooth data,
  including the propagation of Teukolsky waves within a flat
  background, the perturbation of a Kerr black hole with a Teukolsky
  wave, and the injection of a gravitational-wave pulse from the
  characteristic grid. Our investigations reveal no numerical
  instabilities in the simulations. In addition, the tests indicate
  that the CCM algorithm effectively directs characteristic
  information into the inner Cauchy system, yielding higher precision
  in waveforms and smaller violations of Bondi-gauge constraints,
  especially when the outer boundary of the Cauchy evolution is at a
  smaller radius.
