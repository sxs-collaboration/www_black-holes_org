  When one splits spacetime into space plus time, the Weyl curvature
  tensor (which equals the Riemann tensor in vacuum) splits into two
  spatial, symmetric, traceless tensors: the tidal field \(E\), which
  produces tidal forces, and the frame-drag field \(B\), which produces
  differential frame dragging. In recent papers, we and colleagues
  have introduced ways to visualize these two fields: tidal tendex
  lines (integral curves of the three eigenvector fields of \(E\)) and
  their tendicities (eigenvalues of these eigenvector fields)/ and the
  corresponding entities for the frame-drag field: frame-drag vortex
  lines and their vorticities. These entities fully characterize the
  vacuum Riemann tensor. In this paper, we compute and depict the
  tendex and vortex lines, and their tendicities and vorticities,
  outside the horizons of stationary (Schwarzschild and Kerr) black
  holes/ and we introduce and depict the black holes' horizon
  tendicity and vorticity (the normal-normal components of \(E\) and \(B\)
  on the horizon). For Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes, the horizon
  tendicity is proportional to the horizon's intrinsic scalar
  curvature, and the horizon vorticity is proportional to an extrinsic
  scalar curvature. We show that, for horizon-penetrating time slices,
  all these entities (\(E\), \(B\), the tendex lines and vortex lines, the
  lines' tendicities and vorticities, and the horizon tendicities and
  vorticities) are affected only weakly by changes of slicing and
  changes of spatial coordinates, within those slicing and coordinate
  choices that are commonly used for black holes. [Abstract is
  abbreviated.]
