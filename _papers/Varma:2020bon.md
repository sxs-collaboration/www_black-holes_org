  Binary black holes with spins that are aligned with the orbital
  angular momentum do not precess. However, post-Newtonian
  calculations predict that "up-down" binaries, in which the spin of
  the heavier (lighter) black hole is aligned (antialigned) with the
  orbital angular momentum, are unstable when the spins are slightly
  perturbed from perfect alignment. This instability provides a
  possible mechanism for the formation of precessing binaries in
  environments where sources are preferentially formed with (anti)
  aligned spins. In this paper, we present the first full numerical
  relativity simulations capturing this instability. These simulations
  span $\sim 100$ orbits and $\sim 3$-$5$ precession cycles before
  merger, making them some of the longest numerical relativity
  simulations to date. Initialized with a small perturbation of
  $1^{\circ}$-$10^{\circ}$, the instability causes a dramatic growth
  of the spin misalignments, which can reach $\sim 90^{\circ}$ near
  merger. We show that this leaves a strong imprint on the subdominant
  modes of the gravitational wave signal, which can potentially be
  used to distinguish up-down binaries from other sources. Finally, we
  show that post-Newtonian and effective-one-body approximants are
  able to reproduce the unstable dynamics of up-down binaries
  extracted from numerical relativity.
