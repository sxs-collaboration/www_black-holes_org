  Quasinormal mode (QNM) modeling is an invaluable tool for
  characterizing remnant black holes, studying strong gravity, and
  testing general relativity. Only recently have QNM studies begun to
  focus on multimode fitting to numerical relativity strain waveforms.
  As gravitational wave observatories become even more sensitive they
  will be able to resolve higher-order modes. Consequently, multimode
  QNM fits will be critically important, and in turn require a more
  thorough treatment of the asymptotic frame at <math
  display="inline"><msup><mi
  mathvariant="script">I</mi><mo>+</mo></msup></math>. The first main
  result of this work is a method for systematically fitting a QNM
  model containing many modes to a numerical waveform produced using
  Cauchy-characteristic extraction (CCE), a waveform extraction
  technique which is known to resolve memory effects. We choose the
  modes to model based on their power contribution to the residual
  between numerical and model waveforms. We show that the all-mode
  strain mismatch improves by a factor of ∼10⁵ when using multimode
  fitting as opposed to only
  fitting the (2,±2,n) modes. Our most significant result
  addresses a critical point that has been overlooked in the QNM
  literature: the importance of matching the Bondi-van der Burg-
  Metzner-Sachs (BMS) frame of the numerical waveform to that of the
  QNM model. We show that by mapping the numerical waveforms—which
  exhibit the memory effect—to a BMS frame known as the super rest
  frame, there is an improvement of <math
  display="inline"><mo>∼</mo><msup><mn>10</mn><mn>5</mn></msup></math>
  in the all-mode strain mismatch compared to using a strain waveform
  whose BMS frame is not fixed. Furthermore, we find that by mapping
  CCE waveforms to the super rest frame, we can obtain all-mode
  mismatches that are, on average, a factor of <math
  display="inline"><mo>∼</mo><mn>4</mn></math> better than using the
  publicly available extrapolated waveforms. We illustrate the
  effectiveness of these modeling enhancements by applying them to
  families of waveforms produced by numerical relativity and comparing
  our results to previous QNM studies.
