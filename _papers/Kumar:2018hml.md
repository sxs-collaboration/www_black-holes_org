abstract: |
  Gravitational-wave (GW) detectors have begun to observe coalescences
  of heavy black hole binaries (M≳50  M⊙) at a consistent pace for the
  past few years. Accurate models of gravitational waveforms are
  essential for unbiased and precise estimation of source parameters,
  such as masses and spins of component black holes. Recently
  developed surrogate models based on high-accuracy numerical
  relativity (NR) simulations provide ideal models for constraining
  physical parameters describing these heavy black hole merger events.
  In this paper, we first demonstrate the viability of these multi-
  modal surrogate models as reliable parameter estimation tools. We
  show that within a fully Bayesian framework, NR surrogates can help
  extract additional information from GW observations that is
  inaccessible to traditional models. We demonstrate this by analyzing
  a set of synthetic signals with NR surrogate templates and comparing
  against contemporary approximate models. We then consider the case
  of two of the earliest binary black holes detected by the LIGO
  observatories, GW150914 and GW170104. We reanalyze their data with
  the generically precessing NR-based surrogate model and freely
  provide the resulting posterior samples as supplemental material. We
  find that our refined analysis is able to extract information from
  sub-dominant GW harmonics in data, and therefore better resolve the
  degeneracy in measuring source luminosity distance and orbital
  inclination for both events. Our analysis estimates the sources of
  both events to be 20%–25% further away than was previously
  estimated. Our analysis also constrains their orbital orientations
  more tightly around face-on or face-off configurations than before.
  Additionally, for GW150914 we constrain the effective inspiral spin
  χeff more tightly around zero. This work is one of the first to
  unambiguously extract sub-dominant GW mode information from real
  events. It is also a first step toward eliminating the
  approximations used in semi-analytic waveform models from GW
  parameter estimation. It strongly motivates that NR surrogates be
  extended to cover more of the binary black hole parameter space.
