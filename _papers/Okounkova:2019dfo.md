  We produce the first numerical relativity binary black hole
  gravitational waveforms in a higher-curvature theory beyond general
  relativity. In particular, we study head-on collisions of binary
  black holes in order-reduced dynamical Chern-Simons gravity. This is
  a precursor to producing beyond-general-relativity waveforms for
  inspiraling binary black hole systems that are useful for
  gravitational wave detection. Head-on collisions are interesting in
  their own right, however, as they cleanly probe the quasinormal mode
  spectrum of the final black hole. We thus compute the leading-order
  dynamical Chern-Simons modifications to the complex frequencies of
  the postmerger gravitational radiation. We consider equal-mass
  systems, with equal spins oriented along the axis of collision,
  resulting in remnant black holes with spin. We find modifications to
  the complex frequencies of the quasinormal mode spectrum that behave
  as a power law with the spin of the remnant, and that are not
  degenerate with the frequencies associated with a Kerr black hole of
  any mass and spin. We discuss these results in the context of
  testing general relativity with gravitational wave observations.
