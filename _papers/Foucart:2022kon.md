  Recent gravitational wave observations of neutron-star-neutron-star
  and neutron-star-black-hole binaries appear to indicate that massive
  neutron stars may not be too uncommon in merging systems. These
  discoveries have led to an increased interest in the simulation of
  merging compact binaries involving massive stars. In this paper, we
  present a first set of evolution of massive neutron star binaries
  using Monte Carlo radiation transport for the evolution of
  neutrinos. We study a range of systems, from nearly symmetric
  binaries that collapse to a black hole before forming a disk or
  ejecting material, to more asymmetric binaries in which tidal
  disruption of the lower mass star leads to the production of more
  interesting postmerger remnants. For the latter type of systems, we
  additionally study the impact of viscosity on the properties of the
  outflows, and compare our results to two recent simulations of
  identical binaries performed with the whiskythc code. We find
  agreement on the black hole properties, disk mass, and mass and
  velocity of the outflows within expected numerical uncertainties,
  and some minor but noticeable differences in the evolution of the
  electron fraction when using a subgrid viscosity model, with
  viscosity playing a more minor role in our simulations. The method
  used to account for r-process heating in the determination of the
  outflow properties appears to have a larger impact on our result
  than those differences between numerical codes. We also use the
  simulation with the most ejected material to verify that our newly
  implemented Lagrangian tracers provide a reasonable sampling of the
  matter outflows as they leave the computational grid. We note that,
  given the lack of production of hot outflows in these mergers, the
  main role of neutrinos in these systems is to set the composition of
  the postmerger remnant. One of the main potential uses of our
  simulations is, thus, as improved initial conditions for longer
  evolutions of such remnants.
