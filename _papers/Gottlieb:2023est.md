  We present the first numerical simulations that track the evolution
  of a black hole–neutron star (BH–NS) merger from premerger to r ≳
  10$^{11}$ cm. The disk that forms after a merger of mass ratio q = 2
  ejects massive disk winds (3–5 × 10$^{−2}$M$_{⊙}$). We introduce
  various postmerger magnetic configurations and find that initial
  poloidal fields lead to jet launching shortly after the merger. The
  jet maintains a constant power due to the constancy of the large-
  scale BH magnetic flux until the disk becomes magnetically arrested
  (MAD), where the jet power falls off as L$_{j}$ ∼ t$^{−2}$. All jets
  inevitably exhibit either excessive luminosity due to rapid MAD
  activation when the accretion rate is high or excessive duration due
  to delayed MAD activation compared to typical short gamma-ray bursts
  (sGRBs). This provides a natural explanation for long sGRBs such as
  GRB 211211A but also raises a fundamental challenge to our
  understanding of jet formation in binary mergers. One possible
  implication is the necessity of higher binary mass ratios or
  moderate BH spins to launch typical sGRB jets. For postmerger disks
  with a toroidal magnetic field, dynamo processes delay jet launching
  such that the jets break out of the disk winds after several
  seconds. We show for the first time that sGRB jets with initial
  magnetization σ$_{0}$ > 100 retain significant magnetization (σ ≫ 1)
  at r > 10$^{10}$ cm, emphasizing the importance of magnetic
  processes in the prompt emission. The jet–wind interaction leads to
  a power-law angular energy distribution by inflating an energetic
  cocoon whose emission is studied in a companion paper.
