  We present a detailed methodology for extracting the full set of
  Newman-Penrose Weyl scalars from numerically generated spacetimes
  without requiring a tetrad that is completely orthonormal or
  perfectly aligned to the principal null directions. We also describe
  how to implement an extrapolation technique for computing the Weyl
  scalars’ contribution at asymptotic null infinity in postprocessing.
  These methods have been used to produce Ψ4 and h waveforms for the
  Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS) waveform catalog and now have
  been expanded to produce the entire set of Weyl scalars. These new
  waveform quantities are critical for the future of gravitational
  wave astronomy in order to understand the finite-amplitude gauge
  differences that can occur in numerical waveforms. We also present a
  new analysis of the accuracy of waveforms produced by the Spectral
  Einstein Code. While ultimately we expect Cauchy characteristic
  extraction to yield more accurate waveforms, the extraction
  techniques described here are far easier to implement and have
  already proven to be a viable way to produce production-level
  waveforms that can meet the demands of current gravitational-wave
  detectors.
