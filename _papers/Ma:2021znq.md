  We use numerical relativity to study the merger and ringdown stages
  of “superkick” binary black hole systems (those with equal mass and
  antiparallel spins). We find a universal way to describe the mass
  and current quadrupole gravitational waves emitted by these systems
  during the merger and ringdown stage: (i) The time evolutions of
  these waves are insensitive to the progenitor’s parameters (spins)
  after being normalized by their own peak values. (ii) The peak
  values, which encode all the spin information of the progenitor, can
  be consistently fitted to formulas inspired by post-Newtonian
  theory. We find that the universal evolution of the mass quadrupole
  wave can be accurately modeled by the so-called Backwards One-Body
  (BOB) model. However, the BOB model, in its present form, leads to a
  lower waveform match and a significant parameter-estimation bias for
  the current quadrupole wave. We also decompose the ringdown signal
  into seven overtones, and study the dependence of mode amplitudes on
  the progenitor’s parameters. Such dependence is found to be
  insensitive to the overtone index (up to a scaling factor). Finally,
  we use the Fisher matrix technique to investigate how the ringdown
  waveform can be at least as important for parameter estimation as
  the inspiral stage. Assuming the Cosmic Explorer, we find the
  contribution of ringdown portion dominates as the total mass exceeds

  For massive binary black hole (BBH) systems, the accuracy of
  parameter measurement is improved by incorporating the information
  of ringdown—the ringdown sector gives rise to a different parameter
  correlation from inspiral stage; hence, the overall parameter
  correlation is reduced in full signal.
