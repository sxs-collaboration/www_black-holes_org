  The availability of accurate numerical waveforms is an important
  requirement for the creation and calibration of reliable waveform
  models for gravitational wave astrophysics. For black hole-neutron
  star binaries (BHNS), very few accurate waveforms are however
  publicly available. Most recent models are calibrated to a large
  number of older simulations with good parameter space coverage for
  low-spin nonprecessing binaries but limited accuracy, and a much
  smaller number of longer, more recent simulations limited to
  nonspinning black holes. In this paper, we present long, accurate
  numerical waveforms for three new systems that include rapidly
  spinning black holes, and one precessing configuration. We study in
  detail the accuracy of the simulations, and in particular perform
  for the first time in the context of BHNS binaries a detailed
  comparison of waveform extrapolation methods to the results of
  Cauchy characteristic extraction. The new waveforms have <0.1  rad
  phase errors during inspiral, rising to ∼(0.2–0.4)  rad errors at
  merger, and ≲1% error in their amplitude. We compute the
  faithfulness of recent analytical models to these numerical results
  for the late inspiral and merger phases covered by the numerical
  simulations, and find that models specifically designed for BHNS
  binaries perform well (faithfulness F>0.99) for binaries seen face
  on. For edge-on observations, particularly for precessing systems,
  disagreements between models and simulations increase, and models
  that include precession and/or higher-order modes start to perform
  better than BHNS models that currently lack these features.
