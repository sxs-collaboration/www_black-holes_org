  We test the resummation techniques used in developing Padé and
  Effective One Body (EOB) waveforms for gravitational wave detection.
  Convergence tests show that Padé approximants of the gravitational
  wave energy flux do not accelerate the convergence of the standard
  Taylor approximants even in the test mass limit, and there is no
  reason why Padé transformations should help in estimating
  parameters better in data analysis. Moreover, adding a pole to the
  flux seems unnecessary in the construction of these
  Padé-approximated flux formulas. Padé approximants may be useful
  in suggesting the form of fitting formulas. We compare a 15-orbit
  numerical waveform of the Caltech-Cornell group to the suggested
  Padé waveforms of Damour et al. in the equal mass, nonspinning
  quasi-circular case. The comparison suggests that the Padé
  waveforms do not agree better with the numerical waveform than the
  standard Taylor based waveforms. Based on this result, we design a
  simple EOB model by modifiying the ET EOB model of Buonanno et al.,
  using the Taylor series of the flux with an unknown parameter at the
  fourth post-Newtonian order that we fit for. This simple EOB model
  generates a waveform having a phase difference of only 0.002 radians
  with the numerical waveform, much smaller than 0.04 radians the
  phase uncertainty in the numerical data itself. An EOB Hamiltonian
  can make use of a Padé transformation in its construction, but
  this is the only place Padé transformations seem useful.
