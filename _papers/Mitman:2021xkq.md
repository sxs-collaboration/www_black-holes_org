  Understanding the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) frame of the
  gravitational waves produced by numerical relativity is crucial for
  ensuring that analyses on such waveforms are performed properly. It
  is also important that models are built from waveforms in the same
  BMS frame. Up until now, however, the BMS frame of numerical
  waveforms has not been thoroughly examined, largely because the
  necessary tools have not existed. In this paper, we show how to
  analyze and map to a suitable BMS frame for numerical waveforms
  calculated with the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC). However, the
  methods and tools that we present are general and can be applied to
  any numerical waveforms. We present an extensive study of 13 binary
  black hole systems that broadly span parameter space. From these
  simulations, we extract the strain and also the Weyl scalars using
  both SpECTRE’s Cauchy-characteristic extraction module and also the
  standard extrapolation procedure with a displacement memory
  correction applied during postprocessing. First, we show that the
  current center-of-mass correction used to map these waveforms to the
  center-of-mass frame is not as effective as previously thought.
  Consequently, we also develop an improved correction that utilizes
  asymptotic Poincaré charges instead of a Newtonian center-of-mass
  trajectory. Next, we map our waveforms to the post-Newtonian (PN)
  BMS frame using a PN strain waveform. This helps us find the unique
  BMS transformation that minimizes the <math
  display="inline"><msup><mi>L</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></math> norm of
  the difference between the numerical and PN strain waveforms during
  the early inspiral phase. We find that once the waveforms are mapped
  to the PN BMS frame, they can be hybridized with a PN strain
  waveform much more effectively than if one used any of the previous
  alignment schemes, which only utilize the Poincaré transformations.
