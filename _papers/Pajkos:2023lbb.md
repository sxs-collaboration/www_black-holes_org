  We analyze the directional dependence of the gravitational wave (GW)
  emission from 15 3D neutrino radiation hydrodynamic simulations of
  core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Using spin weighted spherical
  harmonics, we develop a new analytic technique to quantify the
  evolution of the distribution of GW emission over all angles. We
  construct a physics-informed toy model that can be used to
  approximate GW distributions for general ellipsoid-like systems, and
  use it to provide closed form expressions for the distribution of
  GWs for different CCSN phases. Using these toy models, we
  approximate the protoneutron star (PNS) dynamics during multiple
  CCSN stages and obtain similar GW distributions to simulation
  outputs. When considering all viewing angles, we apply this new
  technique to quantify the evolution of preferred directions of GW
  emission. For nonrotating cases, this dominant viewing angle drifts
  isotropically throughout the supernova, set by the dynamical
  timescale of the PNS. For rotating cases, during core bounce and the
  following tens of milliseconds, the strongest GW signal is observed
  along the equator. During the accretion phase, comparable—if not
  stronger—GW amplitudes are generated along the axis of rotation,
  which can be enhanced by the low T/∣W∣ instability. We show two
  dominant factors influencing the directionality of GW emission are
  the degree of initial rotation and explosion morphology. Lastly,
  looking forward, we note the sensitive interplay between GW detector
  site and supernova orientation, along with its effect on detecting
  individual polarization modes.
