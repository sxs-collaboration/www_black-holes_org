  Errors due to imperfect boundary conditions in numerical relativity
  simulations of binary black holes (BBHs) can produce unphysical
  reflections of gravitational waves which compromise the accuracy of
  waveform predictions, especially for subdominant modes. A system of
  higher order absorbing boundary conditions which greatly reduces
  this problem was introduced in earlier work (Buchman and Sarbach
  2006 Class. Quantum Grav. 23 6709). In this paper, we devise two new
  implementations of this boundary condition system in the Spectral
  Einstein Code (SpEC), and test them in both linear multipolar
  gravitational wave and inspiralling mass ratio 7:1 BBH simulations.
  One of our implementations in particular is shown to be extremely
  robust and to produce accuracy superior to the standard
  freezing-Î¨\(_{0}\) boundary condition usually used by SpEC.
