  We present the first numerical relativity waveforms for binary black
  hole mergers produced using spectral methods that show both the
  displacement and the spin memory effects. Explicitly, we use the SXS
  (Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes) Collaboration’s spec code to run a
  Cauchy evolution of a binary black hole merger and then extract the
  gravitational wave strain using spectre’s version of a Cauchy-
  characteristic extraction. We find that we can accurately resolve
  the strain’s traditional m=0 memory modes and some of the m≠0
  oscillatory memory modes that have previously only been theorized.
  We also perform a separate calculation of the memory using equations
  for the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs charges as well as the energy and
  angular momentum fluxes at asymptotic infinity. Our new calculation
  uses only the gravitational wave strain and two of the Weyl scalars
  at infinity. Also, this computation shows that the memory modes can
  be understood as a combination of a memory signal throughout the
  binary’s inspiral and merger phases, and a quasinormal mode signal
  near the ringdown phase. Additionally, we find that the magnetic
  memory, up to numerical error, is indeed zero as previously
  conjectured. Last, we find that signal-to-noise ratios of memory for
  LIGO, the Einstein Telescope, and the Laser Interferometer Space
  Antenna with these new waveforms and new memory calculation are
  larger than previous expectations based on post-Newtonian or minimal
  waveform models.
