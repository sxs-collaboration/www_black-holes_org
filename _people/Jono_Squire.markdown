##### Research Projects

Magnetic field generation (dynamo) in turbulence, including in accretion disks and protoneutron
stars

##### Biography

I carried out my undergraduate degree in physics at Otago University in New Zealand, before coming
to Princeton on a Fulbright in 2010 to start a PhD at the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab. Here I
worked on a variety of projects, mainly related to theoretical aspects of plasma physics and fusion
energy, before starting thesis work with Amitava Bhattacharjee on turbulence and magnetic field
generation in accretion disks. I came to Caltech in 2015, where I am currently a Walter Burke Fellow
in Theoretical Astrophysics.
