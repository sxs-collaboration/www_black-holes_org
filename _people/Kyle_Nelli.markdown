##### Research Projects

Lead developer of [SpECTRE](https://github.com/sxs-collaboration/spectre), our
next-generation numerical relativity code. I focus largely on the parallelism
aspects of our simulations along with horizon tracking with our control systems.

##### Biography

I received a BS in Physics and a BS in Astronomy from the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign in 2020. While at UIUC, I did research under Stuart Shapiro
visualizing output from simulations done with the private IllinoisGRMHD code.
Now I am a PhD candidate at Caltech under Saul Teukolsky.
