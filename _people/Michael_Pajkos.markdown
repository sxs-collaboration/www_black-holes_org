##### Research profile

I am interested in high-energy events in the cosmos.  My mentees and I use predictions of `multimessenger' signals from stellar explosions to better understand their properties.  I also investigate how small scale particles---like pions and muons---can affect the behavior of large-scale events---like when stellar remnants called neutron stars collide. 

I also develop supernova simulations for the 
[SpECTRE](https://github.com/sxs-collaboration/spectre) code, incorporating new kinds of physics to perform next-generation simulations of these cataclysmic events.  In the past, I also developed software for the [Flash-X](https://flash-x.org) code, contributing to the [Exascale Computing Project](https://www.exascaleproject.org/), and have performed observational studies of variable stars, whose brightness changes.

##### Biography

I am currently a postdoctoral scholar at Caltech working with Saul Teukolsky.  I received a Ph.D. from Michigan State University working with Prof. Sean Couch.  Outside of research, I am interested in applying effective ways to teach astrophysics in the classroom and outreach settings.
