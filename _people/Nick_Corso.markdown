##### Research Projects

Contributor to [SpECTRE](https://github.com/sxs-collaboration/spectre),
currently using it to study core-collapse supernovae.

##### Biography

I received a BS in Astronomy and Astrophysics from the University of Chicago
in 2022. Currently, I'm a PhD candidate at Cornell University, working under
the supervision of Professors Saul Teukolsky and Nils Deppe to compare
methods of estimating or extracting gravitational waveforms from core-collapse
supernovae induced by a hadron-quark phase transition.
