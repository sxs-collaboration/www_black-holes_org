##### Biography

I graduated from Princeton in 2014, with a major in physics and a minor in computer science. I am
currently getting my PhD in physics at Caltech, where I am advised by Yanbei Chen and work closely
with Mark Scheel and other members of the SXS collaboration. I also lead the TAPIR numerical
relativity group meetings.
