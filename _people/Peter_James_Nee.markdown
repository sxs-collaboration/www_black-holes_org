##### Biography

I am currently a PhD researcher under the supervision of Prof. Harald Pfeiffer at the Max Plank Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute) in Potsdam, Germany. Before this, I completed my BSc in Applied and Computational Mathematics at the University College Dublin in 2021, and a MASt in Applied Mathematics at the University of Cambridge in 2022. My research concerns extending our current Numerical Relativity techniques to new types of systems, such as eccentric binary black hole systems or black holes in theories beyond general relativity.
