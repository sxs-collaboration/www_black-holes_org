##### Research Projects

Building empirical gravitational waveform models from numerical relativity simulations

##### Biography

Biography: After receiving my bachelor's degree in honours Mathematics and Physics from the
University of British Columbia in 2011, I went to the Perimeter Institute for the PSI master's
program. In the fall of 2012 I began my PhD studies at CalTech and am currently part of the TAPIR
group run by Christian Ott.

My primary research project is building highly accurate waveform models out of selected numerical
relativity binary black hole simulations through reduced order modelling.  Outside of academia, I
attempt to injure myself by running too far, sometimes up mountains.
