##### Research Projects

My research deals with computing BMS charges from post-Newtonian theory to fix
the inspiral frame of a binary system in numerical relativity simulation.  

##### Biography

I received my BS-MS degree in 2019 from Indian Institute of Science Education
and Research (IISER) Pune, India. Currently, I am a PhD student at the
University of Mississippi under the supervision of Dr. Leo C Stein.

My research focuses on using post-Newtonian (PN) analytical methods to improve
waveform modeling in numerical relativity. Specifically, I use PN theory to investigate
phenomenological features in numerical relativity waveforms and to improve the
frame alignment of the numerical simulations during the inspiral phase.
