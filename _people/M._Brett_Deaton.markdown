##### Biography

I’m a 6th-year astrophysics graduate student at Washington State University.

In my research I am interested in compact objects, especially mergers of neutron stars and black
holes, and the related observational phenomena of gravitational waves, gamma ray bursts, radio
transients, and kilonovae. I focus on understanding radiative transfer of energy in these extreme
astrophysical environments. I use a computational theoretical approach.

I love to teach! My goal as a teacher is similar to my goal as a scientific observer: “to lean into
the kernel”*. This goal drives my teaching. When I lecture about some piece of the world, I lean
into it alone, in preparation, even if it’s an old topic. Then in the classroom, I listen to my
students, who often voice questions I’ve never considered. The whole classroom grows when we lean in
to hear them.
